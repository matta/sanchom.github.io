But who would keep a pack of hounds; or what gen­tle­man, at the sound of the horn, and at peep of day, would mount his steed, and for hours to­geth­er, “<em>sub jove fri­gi­do</em>,” [un­der cold Jupiter] or a ver­ti­cal sun, pur­sue the wind­ings of this wily quadruped, if, just as night came on, and his strat­a­gems and strength were near­ly ex­haust­ed, a <u>saucy in­trud­er</u>, who had not shared in the <u>ho­n­ours or labours of the chase</u>, were per­mit­ted to come in at the death, and bear away in tri­umph the ob­ject of pur­suit?</blockquote><h3 hyphens="none">Economic efficiency</h3><p>Livingstone is ar­gu­ing that there is so­cial good in killing fox­es, par­tic­u­lar­ly be­cause of their dam­age to farm an­i­mals. It’s im­por­tant to en­cour­age the fox hunt be­cause it kills fox­es. If a hunter who spent a bunch of effort on pur­su­ing a fox might lose it to a “saucy in­trud­er”, there will be few­er hunters will­ing to put in that effort, and there will be few­er fox­es killed. So, let’s not re­ward that in­trud­er with own­er­ship of the fox.</p><p>These are not ob­vi­ous moves. You might think—a lot of peo­ple think—that judges mere­ly try to dis­cov­er what the law <em>is</em>. And some peo­ple think that is a search for some­thing called “nat­ur­al law”: law that ex­ists in­de­pen­dent­ly of our par­tic­u­lar cir­cum­stances and so­ci­eties—ob­jec­tive moral truth. Or, slight­ly less ex­treme, that judges are search­ing for a rule that is based on long-stand­ing, even though so­cial­ly con­tin­gent, ideas about what is <em>right</em> in a moral sense. This case makes it clear that judges some­times <em>make</em> law, and they some­times make law based on prag­mat­ic con­cerns and eco­nom­ic con­cerns.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-5" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-5-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-5-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none">Or maybe, they are <em>al­ways</em> maximizing economic efficiency.

The pa­per is fair­ly read­able even if you ig­nore every equa­tion.</p><p>Thinking about prop­er­ty al­lo­ca­tion from this eco­nom­ic per­spec­tive is only a tool for ex­press­ing rea­sons; it doesn’t pro­vide rea­sons on its own. What you choose to cap­ture in the wel­fare func­tion can near­ly an­swer the ques­tion for you. In Dharmapala and Pitchford’s ar­ti­cle, they in­clud­ed the price per pelt, en­joy­ment of the hunt, dam­age avert­ed to farm an­i­mals, in­vest­ment by the hunter, and in­vest­ment by the saucy in­trud­er. What about oth­er ex­ter­nal­i­ties? Enforcement/lit­i­ga­tion costs might be significantly different un­der each of the rules. In fact, the ma­jor­i­ty ar­gues this, and Dharmapala and Pitchford ex­pand their wel­fare func­tion to in­clude en­force­ment costs lat­er in the pa­per. This just high­lights how the definition of the so­cial wel­fare func­tion is a po­lit­i­cal ques­tion. And, the max­i­miza­tion of it is con­tin­gent on ac­tu­al facts, some of which might not ac­tu­al­ly be known or know­able. Why does the orig­i­nal hunter get zero pos­i­tive en­joy­ment when the in­trud­er gets the fox?  Even as­sum­ing that the pos­i­tive ex­pe­ri­ence dur­ing the hunt is di­min­ished when the in­trud­er gets the fox, why does it can­cel per­fect­ly to zero?</p><p>It turns out that hunters found plea­sure in the hunt even if they didn’t end up catch­ing a fox.

The hunters would have to pay the in­trud­ers as much mon­ey as they’d oth­er­wise be able to fetch by free­load­ing. But this seems un­ten­able, be­cause more and more peo­ple could show up de­mand­ing pay­ment to stay out of the way of the hunt. Historically, though, it seems that rather than the in­trud­ers be­ing mere free­load­ers, they were farm­ers just try­ing to en­sure the fox­es got killed, to pre­vent in­jury to their own an­i­mals.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-9" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-9-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-9-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none"><span class="bibliography-entry" data-citation-id="McDowell"><span>McDowell</span>, <em>supra</em> note 7.</span></label></span></span> If the only peo­ple that were in­trud­ing were farm­ers at risk of los­ing an­i­mals to fox­es, then a Coasian so­lu­tion could ac­tu­al­ly play out. The hunters would pay the farm­ers for dam­age that hap­pens to come to their farms due to fox­es: a kind of tax/in­sur­ance for hav­ing a pure hunt.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-10" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-10-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-10-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none"><span class="bibliography-entry" data-citation-id="McDowell"><em>Ibid</em>.</span></label></span></span> Another op­tion would be pay­ments to the own­er(s) of the land on which the hunt takes place in ex­change for the ex­clu­sive right to hunt.

The sit­u­a­tion, ab­stract­ly, is that there are two groups of peo­ple seek­ing benefit from a lim­it­ed re­source. The re­source is such that it takes some effort to ex­tract val­ue from that re­source and the per­son to ini­ti­ate that effort doesn’t nec­es­sar­i­ly gain ex­clu­sive pos­ses­sion of that val­ue for quite some time, leav­ing room for a “saucy in­trud­er” to cut in and free­load or hold hostage the val­ue de­sired by the per­son who un­der­took the ini­tial in­vest­ment of effort.</p><p>Dharmapala and Pitchford ar­gue that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersquatting">cy­ber­squat­ting</a> match­es this sce­nario.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-11" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-11-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-11-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none"><span class="bibliography-entry" data-citation-id="Dharmapala"><span>Dharmapala</span>, <em>supra</em> note 6.</span></label></span></span> Should a do­main name be giv­en to the first per­son to reg­is­ter it with­out re­gard to whether an­oth­er has al­ready de­vel­oped a brand around that name?

What if the orig­i­nal in­ven­tor gets rights while they are still in “mere pur­suit” of the in­ven­tion? As per Livingstone’s analy­sis, this will dis­cour­age the saucy in­trud­er. Here, though, the saucy in­trud­er is a would-be in­ven­tor, a would-be im­prover. We don’t want to dis­cour­age this ac­tiv­i­ty. That would work against the goals of the patent sys­tem.</p><p>Oullette ar­gues that this hap­pens when we give peo­ple patents that are too spec­u­la­tive and that re­quire un­due ex­per­i­men­ta­tion on the part of any­one want­i­ng to use the patent. These patents don’t do much to low­er the bar­ri­er to fur­ther im­prove­ment, but they re­ward the orig­i­nal “in­ven­tor” with an un­earned right to ex­clude. This dis­cour­ages the flurry of im­prove­ment patents that one might nor­mal­ly see af­ter a sufficiently dis­closed in­ven­tion is patent­ed.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-15" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-15" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-15-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-15-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none"><span class="bibliography-entry" data-citation-id="Oullette"><span>Oullette</span>, <em>supra</em> note 12.</span></label></span></span> She ar­gues that this is a de­fect in the ex­am­i­na­tion process.</p><h3 hyphens="none">How people use this case</h3><p>I found an ar­ti­cle by Luke Meier on <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2824501">us­ing <em>Pierson v Post</em> as the first case in prop­er­ty law</a>. This is al­most a tran­script of how he would teach his first few class­es.</p><p>It seems that it’s com­mon to use this as the first case in a prop­er­ty law course. We didn’t look at this case first. We start­ed by think­ing about what rights are part of the bun­dle of rights called prop­er­ty, how those are con­tex­tu­al, and the different roles that prop­er­ty rights fill in our so­ci­ety. Only now, sev­en weeks in, are we start­ing to look at what is re­quired, or what should be re­quired, to gain pos­ses­sion of a thing.</p><div class="endnotes print-only"><p><h2 hyphens="none">Notes</h2></p><p class="footnote" id="fn-1">1. <a href="#fn-source-1" class="backlink undecorated"> ↑ </a><span class="bibliography-entry full-form-citation" data-citation-id="Pierson" data-citation-pinpoint="false" data-citation-parenthetical="false" data-citation-judge="false" data-citation-speaker="false" data-citation-signal="false"><em><a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/archives/pierson_post.htm">Pierson v Post</a></em>, 3 Cai R 175 (NY SC1805)<span data-short-form-placeholder="Pierson"></span>.</span> There’s a good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierson_v._Post">Wikipedia ar­ti­cle</a> too.</p><p class="footnote" id="fn-2">2. <a href="#fn-source-2" class="backlink undecorated"> ↑ </a>I’ve pre­sent­ed only the scant facts as out­lined in the case.
