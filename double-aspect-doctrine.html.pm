◊fig[#:src "assets/pipelines-double-aspect.png" #:width "500px"]{The
double-aspect doctrine explains why the provincial and federal
government might both be able to make legislation relating to a
particular field. On April 26, 2018, the BC government asked the BC
Court of Appeal to decide (among other things) whether the province
has the power to make certain amendments to the to the Environmental
Management Act that would affect a proposed pipeline being built by
the federal government. See the ◊a[#:href

Federalism is a broad subcategory within Canadian constitutional
law. In this context, federalism refers to the division of law-making
power between our provincial and federal governments.

◊q{In a federal system of government such as ours, political power is
shared by two orders of government: the federal government on the one
hand, and the provinces on the other. Each is assigned respective
spheres of jurisdiction by the ◊em{Constitution Act, 1867}. The
federal structure of our country also facilitates democratic
participation by distributing power to the government thought to be
most suited to achieving the particular societal objective having
regard to this diversity.◊note{◊cite-case[#:title "Reference re

But, this division of power is not watertight. "The history of
Canadian constitutional law has been to allow for a fair amount of
interplay and indeed overlap between federal and provincial
powers."◊note{◊cite-case[#:url

through the double-aspect doctrine.

the case generally used to introduce the double-aspect doctrine,
conflates two kinds of doubleness and this can lead to an overly
narrow conception of the doctrine. This article presents how I've come
to think of the double-aspect doctrine and one way of teasing apart
the ways in which the doctrine is used.

◊em{Multiple Access} concerned legislation enacted by the federal and
Ontario governments with provisions that overlapped significantly both
in their expression and in the people and conduct covered. Exemplary
of that duplication are s 100.4 of the ◊em{Canada Corporations
Act}◊note{◊em{Canada Corporations act}, RSC 1970, c C-32 (as amended
by RSC 1970 (1st Supp.), c 10, s 7), s 100.4(1) ("Every insider of a
company, every person employed or retained by the company, the auditor
of the company and every associate of the insider and affiliate of the
insider within the meaning of subsection 125(3) who, in connection
with a transaction relating to the securities of the company, makes
use of any specific confidential information for his own benefit or
advantage that, if generally known, might reasonably be expected to
affect materially the value of the securities of the company, is
liable to compensate any person for any direct loss suffered by that
person as a result of the transaction, unless the information was
known or ought reasonably to have been known to that person at the
time of such transaction, and is also accountable to the company for
any direct benefit or advantage received or receivable by such
insider, employed or retained person, auditor, associate or affiliate,
as the case may be, as a result of the transaction").} and s 113 of
Ontario's ◊em{Securities Act}◊note{◊em{The Securities Act}, RSO 1970,
c 426, s 113(1) ("Every insider of a corporation or associate or
affiliate of such insider, who, in connection with a transaction
relating to the capital securities of the corporation, makes use of
any specific confidential information for his own benefit or advantage
that, if generally known, might reasonably be expected to affect
materially the value of such securities, is liable to compensate any
person or company for any direct loss suffered by such person or
company as a result of such transaction, unless such information was
known or ought reasonably to have been known to such person or company
at the time of such transaction, and is also accountable to the
corporation for any direct benefit or advantage received or receivable
by such insider, associate or affiliate, as the case may be, as a
result of such transaction").}.

Multiple Access Ltd was a federally incorporated company, so was
within scope of the ◊em{Canada Corporations Act}. It also had its public
stock listed for trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, bringing it
within the scope of Ontario's ◊em{Securities Act}.

Multiple Access's shareholders got Ontario's Securities Commission to
commence insider-trading enforcement against the company under the
Ontario act. That shareholders could have equally sought
enforcementunder the federal act, but the limitations period under the
federal act had expired. This was the only material difference between
the two acts as they applied to this company.

Multiple Access asked the court to deem the federal act (with the
already-expired limitations period) to be valid and thus render the
provincial law invalid. That implication would follow if the validity
of a federal provision precludes the validity of a provincial law in
substantially the same form given the division of powers set out in
ss 91 and 92 of the ◊em{Constitution Act, 1867}. Multiple Access was
aruging that a particular provision could only be valid as either
federal or provincial legislation.

The court used the double-aspect doctrine to avoid this choice. It
explained the doctrine using material from an article by William
Lederman, "Classification of Laws and the British North America Act."
Lederman's article and ◊em{Multiple Access} contemplate one kind of
scenario in which the double-aspect doctrine can arise (choosing which
of the federal or provincial governments gets to pass a particular
law), but in this scenario, two kinds of doubleness are conflated.

◊em{Multiple Access} and Lederman's article talk about the
double-aspect doctrine as if the federal and provincial governments
are playing tug-of-war over one particular law, asking, "who gets to
enact it?" Double-aspect enters when the answer is, "both of you."
This is the setting where we look for a 50/50 pull between the
provincial and federal features of a law.

◊q{
◊elide some overlapping inevitably remains. Where this occurs, either
one of two things has then been done. First, the nature of ◊u{the
challenged law} relevant to a provincial class of powers has been
completely ignored as only an "incidental affectation" of the
provincial sphere, and ◊u{the law} concerned has been classed only by
that feature of it relevant to a federal class of laws. Thus, in spite
of the logical overlap the decision is made that only the federal
Parliament has power to enact ◊u{the challenged law}. Obviously this
decision involves a judgement that the provincial feature of ◊u{the
law} is quite unimportant relative to its federal feature. On the
other hand if the federal feature be deemed quite unimportant relative
to the provincial feature, then the converse decision would be
made. ◊elide

But, if the contrast between the relative importance of the two
features is not so sharp ◊elide the decision is made that ◊u{the
challenged rule} could be enacted by either the federal Parliament or
a provincial legislature. [emphasis added]
}

However, the double-aspect doctrine is not so narrow. In 1883, the
Privy Council characterized it broadly: "subjects which in one aspect
and for one purpose fall within section 92, may in another aspect and
for another purpose fall within section 91."◊note{◊cite-case[#:title
"Hodge v The Queen" #:citation "[1883] UKPC 59" #:url
"http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1883/1883_59.html"]} Some notes
in ◊em{Canadian Constitutional Law} try to explain this, but it's easy
to miss.◊note{◊cite-book[#:author "Patrick Macklem et al" #:title
"Canadian Constitutional Law" #:publisher "Emond" #:location "Toronto"
#:year "2016" #:pinpoint "233"]} In its broadest conception, the
double-aspect doctrine explains any scenario where the courts allow
legislation from our two levels of government to touch a particular
field. The double-aspect doctrine is not reserved for cases where the
two levels of government play tug-of-war over a provision; it is also
at play when they play tug-of-war over a field, through ◊em{different
provisions}, through ◊em{different} law.

"In most cases, application of the doctrine simply entails the court
evidencing a willingness to apply the pith and substance doctrine
flexibly, and to characterize similar federal and provincial
enactments in such a manner as to permit the court to uphold both
enactments as valid."◊note{◊em{Ibid} at 233.}

Here are some more recent statements that demonstrate the breadth of
the doctrine:

◊q{ Activities, acts or conduct can sometimes be viewed from different
normative perspectives, one relating to a federal power and the other
to a provincial power. Where this is the case, the double aspect
doctrine is engaged.◊note{◊cite-case[#:title "Reference re Assisted
Human Reproduction Act" #:citation "2010 SCC 61" #:pinpoint "para 185"

◊q{ "Double occupancy" of a field of endeavour, such as health, is a
permanent feature of the Canadian constitutional order. It leads to a
standard "double aspect" analysis under which both aspects subsist
side by side.◊note{◊em{Ibid} at para 67.}  }

◊q{ [G]aming is a matter that falls within the "double aspect"
doctrine.  Accordingly, gaming can be subject to legislation by both
the federal and provincial governments.◊note{◊cite-case[#:title
