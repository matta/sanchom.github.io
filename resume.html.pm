◊h4{Research Assistant, University of Manitoba — 2005}
I worked with Dr. Jacky Baltes in the Autonomous Agents Laboratory on a small, humanoid robot. I wrote vision algorithms and developed a stable walking gait for the robot.

◊h4{Research and Development, Frantic Films — 2006}
I did production work for ◊em{Superman Returns} and software development for their rendering pipeline.

◊h4{Software Engineer Intern, Google — 2010, 2011}
In 2010, I helped develop a prototype Android application with the Geo/Street View team.

In 2011, I worked on improving the automatic organization of YouTube data.

◊h4{Research and Development, Shelfie — 2014-}
Shelfie was an app that automatically identified books in photos
that our users took of their bookshelves. I wrote most of the automatic recognition system, including feature-based nearest-neighbor matching,
text-recognition, and convolutional neural networks. I created custom validation datasets and tools for quality control. I managed our SRED and IRAP projects, drafted patent applications, and mentored teammates when they helped with this research. The tech and team is now part of Kobo.

◊h4{Leadership, volunteering, hobbies}

I have a Commercial Pilot Licence and a Class 1 Flight Instructor
Rating. I got most of my flight experience as a flight instructor at
Flying Colors Pilot Training and flew with their precision flight
team. I've also delivered flight training to Canadian Forces pilots
taking their Primary Flight Training and have held a Class 2 Aerobatic
Flight Instructor rating. I won the ◊a[#:href

C. Webster Memorial Trophy}. Today, I stay current by flying
recreationally around the lower mainland of British Columbia.

I was a member of the Canadian Forces in the Cadet Instructor Cadre. I
organized training programs, created and taught an introductory
aviation course, developed junior instructors, and had many other
ad-hoc leadership roles.

During my time at UBC, I held several volunteer roles in the
Department of Computer Science at UBC. I led activities for outreach
programs, I was a member of the department's recruiting and admissions
committee, and I've helped deliver the TA training program. I was the
president of the Computer Science Graduate Student Association and I
was a councilor representing the computer science graduate students in
UBC's Graduate Student Society.

I am the webmaster for the Webster Memorial Trophy Competition. I
manage the technical setup of their website and also do some
copywriting.

I'm an ◊a[#:href
