Here are some things that I've read (or listened to, or watched) that
have helped develop my understanding of colonialism and its effects on
Indigenous people in Canada.◊note{I'm maintaining this page in
response to the [Calls for Justice from the National Inquiry into
Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and
Girls](https://www.mmiwg-ffada.ca/), specifically Call for Justice
6.1: "We call upon all media, news corporations and outlets, and, in
particular, ◊ellipsis bloggers ◊ellipsis, to take decolonizing
approaches to their work and publications in order to educate all
Canadians about Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA people" and to
"[s]upport Indigenous people sharing their stories, from their
perspectives ◊ellipsis"} I'll keep this updated.
