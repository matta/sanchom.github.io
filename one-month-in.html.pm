‚óägfyfig[#:gfy "grouchyneatbronco" #:width "360px"]{"I know kung fu."}

One month into law school, and I feel a little like Neo after being
jacked into the information pipe. But, as you might remember from the
next scene, he was far from ready for the Matrix. That's the level
that we're learning things at right now---a basic literacy of broad
areas of law, so we will know how to understand new cases, what
questions to ask, and what arguments are valid. I also feel quite
unprepared to apply anything just yet. Maybe it will always feel like
this!

The most common question I'm asked is: "How has your first month
been?" I keep saying that it's been manageable. It's also been
stressful. It's also been really good.

I think the stress has more to do with the stress inherent in any
change rather than due to something specific to law school. This new
thing I'm doing is displacing some old things: no more ‚óäem{Overwatch}, no
more ‚óäem{Hearthstone}, less reading for pure leisure, no binge-watching
‚óäem{The Office}. It's also super engaging and stimulating. So, when I
wake up in the middle of the night, instead of falling right back to
sleep, my mind jumps to a topic we've been talking about in class or
to a reading I just completed. I also moved to a new apartment at the
beginning of October---another change and more work that I had to fit
everything else around.

The second-most common question I'm asked is (from people around me in
class): "What are you using to take your notes?"

I've been using ‚óäa[#:href "https://orgmode.org/"]{org-mode} to take
class notes and I like how that's been working. In case you haven't
heard of org-mode before, it's built in to a plain-text editor called
‚óäa[#:href "https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"]{emacs} and it looks
like this:

‚óäfig[#:src "assets/org-mode-notes.png" #:width "450px"]{Some notes on one of the cases we read in tort law.}

Things I like about taking notes in org-mode:
‚óäul{
‚óäli{The automatic indentation, lists, and collapsible sections}
‚óäli{Tags, although I'm barely using them right now}
‚óäli{Super simple markup for marking things italic or underlined or for making block quotations}
}

And, I've set up my org-mode system to automatically export the notes
to an html file that's saved to Google Drive. That lets me review all
of my notes on my phone on a nice-to-read web page.

‚óäfig[#:src "assets/class-notes-html.jpg" #:width "450px"]{What the
notes end up looking like when I browse them on my phone. The export
also includes a table-of-contents. Forgive the colour clash. It's just
a screenshot from my phone and I made the background of my notes
pinkish so I would feel better while reading them.}

The third-most frequent thing I'm asked is: "Why did you come to law
school? How are you going to use your computer science background?"

At the outset, I'm interested in civil liberties, public-interest law
generally, defendant rights, and copyright. I'm not sure whether I'll
use my computer science background (other than tangentially, like my
note-taking system, or factum-authoring tool), but there are some
topics where my interests seem to intersect. I've thought about some
of these more than others, but here are a few examples: copyright in
AI-generated art, protections against search and seizure of digital
and network evidence, anonymity and privacy rights in general,
algorithmic decision-making in law, and copyright/fair use of code,
APIs, and program outputs. These are not things that I'll get to think
a lot about in first year, but I'm enjoying the foundational topics
that we're focusing on in the meantime. They're certainly complex and
interesting enough.

‚óäsub-heading{Favourite things from each class}
‚óäul{

‚óäli{‚óäb{Legal research and writing}: Getting access to really good
case-law research databases. WestlawNext üëç. Lexis Advance Quicklaw
üëé. And ‚óäa[#:href "https://www.canlii.org/en/"]{CanLII} is actually a
pretty good free database.}

‚óäli{‚óäb{Public law}: Legislative research and statutory
interpretation. So fun to think about words and meaning.‚óänote{This isn't a Canadian case, but it is a good example of the kinds of questions that arise in statutory interpretation: ‚óäa[#:href "https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-7451_m64o.pdf"]{‚óäem{Yates v United States}} (2014), 135 S Ct 1074. Is a fish a tangible object?}}

‚óäli{‚óäb{Contracts}: Thinking about the balance between formality,
giving effect to intent, and protection of weaker parties.}

‚óäli{‚óäb{Criminal law}: Causation. Someone did a thing. Later on, a bad
result happened. Is the person's action sufficiently connected with
the result to warrant punishment?}

‚óäli{‚óäb{Federalism}: That in determining whether the federal (or
provincial) government has the power to make a particular law, there
is a well defined series of questions that you need to work through,
yet in answering those questions, there's much room for legal realism (in the sense that that term is used ‚óäa[#:href "https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5995&context=journal_articles"]{here}).}

‚óäli{‚óäb{Property law}: Public property and how it relates to
homelessness and tent communities.‚óänote{‚óäcite-news[#:author "Cassidy

exact situation as in ‚óäem{Victoria (City) v Adams}: there are more homeless
people than shelter spaces, but sleeping outdoors on public property is
illegal. Sleeping would be illegal for at least some of those without
private space. The challenge to the law was successful.} Also, the economic analysis of law that is so
prominent in property law today.}

(very close to plain text) and would need to create a bibliography
file. My program would then automate the citation layout, paragraph
notes, back-references, the table of authority, and all things related
to formatting. In case you're familiar with LaTeX and think it might
already do this, it doesn't. It needs to be coerced. The per-paragraph
notes for BC factums are not supported in LaTex and it is hard to get
BibTex or Biber to work with legal citations. This is my hobby
programming project right now.}
