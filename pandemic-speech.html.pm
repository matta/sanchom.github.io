◊abstract{

Social-media platforms have adopted an unprecedented approach to
misinformation relating to COVID-19: they are now willing to delete
content that is false. This article situates COVID-19 misinformation
in the spectrum of hate speech, misinformation, and disinformation. It
then explores the social-media platforms' approaches to policing
speech before and during the COVID-19 pandemic through the dual lenses
of the American First Amendment the Canadian
◊em{Charter}. Social-media platforms appear to be making their content
decisions under a framework more akin to that from Canada’s
◊em{Charter} than from the American First Amendment. Further, it is
possible, in admitedly unlikely circumstances, that Canada could
require social-media platforms to perform content-based deletion of
specific misinformation during a pandemic.

This article was prepared in April 2020 for my Communications Law
course at UBC's Peter A. Allard School of Law. I thank Professor
Festinger and my classmates for the valuable discussions about media
and communications. The article is already dated. When I wrote it,
@realdonaldtrump still had a Twitter account and Facebook's Oversight
Board was not yet operational. I am most skeptical of my Section 1
analysis at the end of the article, especially thinking about how
Facebook's Oversight Board recently applied International Human Rights
standards to overturn Facebook's deletion of COVID-19 misinformation.

◊heading{Introduction}

On 27 March 2020, Twitter deleted a tweet written by Rudy Giuliani
that contained a false claim that hydroxychloroquine was "100%
effective" at treating COVID-19.◊note{◊see["Porter"]
◊see-also["Helderman" #:parenthetical "reporting instead that Twitter
“locked Giuliani's account until he deleted [the tweet]”"]} On 30
March 2020, Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube deleted videos of the
Brazilian President, Jair Bolsonaro, that claimed "hydroxychloroquine
is working in all places."◊note{◊cite["Constine"]
◊see-also["Wagner1"]} These deletions reflect an unprecedented change in
the way major social networks treat misinformation.

In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, Twitter, Facebook,
YouTube, Google, and others jointly committed to combat COVID-19
misinformation.◊note-see["Statt"] Twitter and Facebook broadened their
definitions of harm to include COVID-19 misinformation. For example,
Twitter now recognizes as harmful "content that goes directly against
guidance from authoritative sources of global and local public health
information."◊note-cite["Twitter COVID Policy" #:parenthetical
"updated 1 April 2020"] Facebook is deviating from its long-standing
practice of not fact-checking politicians.◊note{◊see["Wagner2"
#:parenthetical "in January, Facebook said they were “sticking with a
controversial policy that stipulates the company will not fact-check
posts from politicians”"]} These changes are a specific response to
COVID-19. These platforms have never before had a policy to delete
pseudoscientific medical misinformation (e.g. claims that homeopathy
or acupuncture are effective, or anti-vaccination propaganda). Only
recently, in late 2019, did Facebook begin downranking---not
deleting---content that contained exaggerated health claims
(e.g. “miracle cure[s]”) or that advertised a health
product.◊note{◊cite["FB Health Claims" #:terminal ";"]
◊see-also["Perez"]}

In this article, I situate COVID-19 misinformation within a spectrum of
hate speech, disinformation, and misinformation. I explain social
media platforms' approach to non-COVID-19 misinformation through a
model of self-governance that has until now appeared rooted in
American First Amendment values. However, the tactics that the
platforms have adopted with respect to COVID-19 misinformation reveal
that their approach to policing expression is actually more akin to
that found in Canada under ss. 1 and 2(b) of the ◊em{Charter of Rights
and Freedoms}.◊note{◊cite["Charter" #:pinpoint "ss 1, 2(b)"] Section
2(b) of the ◊em{Charter} establishes freedom of expression, "including
freedom of the press and other media of communication" as fundamental
freedoms. Section 1 of the ◊em{Charter} "guarantees the rights and
freedoms set out in [the ◊em{Charter}] subject only to such reasonable
limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free
and democratic society."} When deciding to adopt new policies in
response to COVID-19, the platforms are performing a balancing
exercise rather than adopting an absolutist approach to free
expression on their platforms.

I present the factors that the platforms are likely weighing during
this balancing exercise, drawing from the factors that are relevant to
a s. 1 analysis when the government infringes a person's right to free
expression in Canada. The risk of harm appears to play a prominent
role in the platforms' decision-making processes. Yet the risk of harm
is present in non-COVID-19 misinformation as well. I explore the
conception of harm that platforms might be adopting in their balancing
exercise that would explain their hands-off approach until now.

Having made the decision to police this misinformation, the platforms
are now faced with a task they have in the past claimed is
insurmountable: categorizing claims on their platform as true or
false---permissible or impermissible.◊note{◊see-eg["Newton"]} This
involves value-laden decisions about what entities to consider
authoritative, distinguishing claims of fact from opinion, and
assessing the risk of harm. I will present their approach to these
issues.

Last, I consider whether Canada could ◊em{require} platforms to police
COVID-19 misinformation or misinformation more broadly. While this
would almost certainly not be an option available to US legislators, I
conclude that Canada's free-expression jurisprudence leaves open the
possibility for Canadian legislators to require platforms to
intervene---to delete content---in times of discrete emergency.

◊heading{COVID-19 Misinformation}

I refer to the expression being blocked under these policies as
◊em{misinformation}. I adopt a definition of misinformation that
assumes only the falsehood of the statement. Misinformation is broader
than, but includes, ◊em{dis}information, which implies an intentional
effort to deceive. This is a commonly accepted distinction, adopted by
Renee DiResta and Facebook.◊note{◊see["DiResta" #:pinpoint "14"
#:terminal ";"] ◊see-also["FSP" #:pinpoint "04m:50s"]} Given how
difficult it is for a platform to know the intent of the speaker, they
are necessarily disregarding intent in their treatment of COVID-19
misinformation. Misinformation is also different from hate
speech. While hate speech can certainly ◊em{include}
misinformation,◊note-cite["Keegstra" #:parenthetical "“[t]here is very
little chance that statements intended to promote hatred against an
identifiable group are true”" #:pinpoint "763"] the reason platforms
target hate speech is not because it is false.◊note{◊see["Citron:
Addressing Cyber Harassment" #:pinpoint "61--62"] And regarding
political propaganda, another category of suspect speech, see
generally ◊cite["Corbin"]}

Platforms are categorizing COVID-19 misinformation based on its
falsehood. This is a ◊em{content}-based categorization and is a novel
aspect to the platforms' response to COVID-19
misinformation. Platforms have generally not deleted expression based
on its falsehood.◊note-see["Klonick" #:pinpoint "1660"] There are two
notable exceptions. Pinterest prohibits "promotion of false cures for
terminal or chronic illnesses and anti-vaccination
advice."◊note-cite["Pinterest"] And (only since February 2020) YouTube
prohibits a small category of political-process
misinformation.◊note-see["YouTube: Elections"] Platforms have instead
relied on proxy criteria (like the identity of the actor or presence
of deceptive behaviours) to delete likely
◊em{dis}information.◊note-see["Francois"] For example, Facebook has
had little issue removing posts attributed to "well-funded military
and intelligence apparatus" (e.g. Guccifer 2.0).◊note-cite["Francois"
#:pinpoint "3"] And Twitter deletes fake accounts and bots in order to
stamp out "faux-organic" content.◊note-cite["Ravel" #:pinpoint
"1271--72"]

What is new about the platforms' deletion of COVID-19 misinformation
is that they are distinguishing between true and false. Under these
new policies, it does not matter who makes the false claim; it does
not matter whether the claim is part of a deception campaign. Facebook
and Twitter have never before deleted information because it was false
(YouTube has, and only since February 2020).◊note-see["YouTube:
Elections"]

But in the context of a novel global pandemic, full of scientific
uncertainty, what does it mean for a claim to be false? Twitter has
said that it will "prioritiz[e] removing content when it has a clear
call to action that could directly pose a risk to people’s health or
well-being" but that it will not "limit good faith discussion or
expressing hope about ongoing studies related to potential medical
interventions that show promise."◊note-cite["Twitter COVID Policy"]
They will remove "[d]enial of established scientific facts about
transmission during the incubation period or transmission guidance
from global and local health authorities."◊note-cite["Twitter COVID
Policy"] Facebook will take down content that is "provably false",
that "has been flagged by a global health expert like the [World
Health Organization (WHO)]," and "could lead to imminent
harm."◊note-cite["FSP" #:pinpoint "08m:40s"] YouTube will delete "any
content that disputes the existence or transmission of Covid-19, as
described by the WHO and local health
authorities."◊note-cite["Kelion"] But “[f]or borderline content that
could misinform users in harmful ways,” they only reduce
recommendations of that content.◊note-cite["Kelion"]

In these policy statements we see the platforms adopting the
fact--opinion distinction familiar from defamation
law.◊note{◊see["Torstar" #:pinpoint "para 31" #:terminal ";"]
◊cite["Gertz" #:terminal ";"] ◊cite["Milkovich"]} These statements
also reveal the harm-based motivation for adopting this more proactive
approach to COVID-19 misinformation. Third, they have all identified
authoritative sources of the truth for the purpose of their policies.

◊heading{Non-COVID-19 Misinformation}

These policies are at odds with the platforms' traditional approach to
misinformation. While platforms have had policies against "gratuitous
violence" and pornography that is in-line with obscenity norms in
American media, they have not attempted to divide truth from fiction
or fair from unfair.◊note-see["Klonick" #:pinpoint "1626, 1660"]
Twitter took such a hands-off approach that it was called "the free
speech wing of the free speech party."◊note{◊see["Klonick" #:pinpoint
"1620--21"] ◊see-also["Jeong" #:parenthetical "presenting Twitter's
early rules: “we will not actively monitor and will not censor user
content, except in the limited circumstances below,” referring to
categories of “Impersonation, Privacy, Violence and Threats,
Copyright, Unlawful Use, Serial Accounts, Name Squatting,
Malware/Phishing, Spam, and Pornography”"]} Kate Klonick hypothesizes
that the "normative background" of the early in-house counsel at these
platforms was so infused with First Amendment doctrine that they
effectively imported it into Twitter, Facebook, and
Youtube.◊note-see["Klonick" #:pinpoint "1621"]

Where platforms ◊em{have} prohibited content (e.g. obscenity,
violence, hate speech), they have been motivated by corporate identity
and monetary interests.◊note-see["Klonick" #:pinpoint "1626--27"]
Misinformation has been policed only by proxy: by targeting bad actors
or bad behaviour.◊note-see["Francois"] But platforms have avoided
assuming a role as arbiters of truth. If a private individual says
something openly using their primary, personally-identified account,
no matter how false or harmful the information might have been, the
platforms have left it up. Only recently have the platforms started to
police misinformation ◊em{qua} misinformation and it has been with a
light touch.

What follows next is a summary of the (often recent) high-water mark
of each platform's treatment of non-COVID-19 misinformation.

◊sub-heading{Facebook}

"[F]alse news does not violate [Facebook's] Community
Standards."◊note-cite["FB: Lyons"] Unless it violates one of their
other content policies, Facebook will not take down
misinformation. Their approach to tackling misinformation (since
2016◊note-see["Constine2"]) has been to use fact-checkers who are
certified by the International Fact-Checking Network. When a
fact-checker judges content to be false, Facebook will downrank the
content so that many fewer people will see it, attach a warning label,
and include a link to corrective information.◊note{◊see["FB: Lyons"
#:terminal ";"] ◊cite["Constine2"] ◊see-generally["Clayton"]}

◊sub-heading{Twitter}

In February, 2020, Twitter announced a policy targeting manipulated
media◊note-see["Twitter Deep Fake Policy"] (e.g. ◊em{deep
fakes}◊note-see-generally["Citron"]). When such manipulated media
risks creating "serious harm," Twitter will delete it; otherwise,
Twitter will simply label it. While this can be construed as targeting
content,◊note-see["Francois" #:parenthetical "policing deep fakes is a
content-based distinction"] this is a special category of
misinformation. The medium has been manipulated or synthetically
generated. Of course there is an ◊em{implicit claim} that the person
depicted in the photo, video, or audio actually did what they have
been depicted doing (e.g. a video depicting a trustworthy person X
advocating dangerous behaviour Y). In this sense, manipulated media
makes a meta claim. Twitter's manipulated-media policy is the closest
that Twitter has come to deleting claims because they are
false. However, Twitter's policies would not result in deletion of a
text-based version of the same claim (e.g. a tweet saying that
"trustworthy person X advocated dangerous behaviour Y"). This reveals
that Twitter's manipulated-media policy requires more than mere
falsehood and harm in order to trigger deletion. Their policy toward
manipulated media is based on the ◊em{manner} in which the claim is
made and thus is more properly categorized as a ◊em{behaviour}-based
distinction.

◊sub-heading{YouTube}

In February, 2020, YouTube announced several categories of content
that it would remove: manipulated media that poses a "serious risk of
egregious harm," misinformation about the "voting or census process,"
and "false claims related to the technical eligibility requirements
for current political candidates."◊note-cite["YouTube: Elections"] The
manipulated-media category is much like that from Twitter's
policy. However, the latter two categories (political-process
misinformation) are rare examples where a platform has decided to
remove misinformation based purely on it being false. This is
low-hanging fruit, given that there is a clear ground truth about what
the voting and census processes involve and what the technical
eligibility requirements are.

◊sub-heading{Alternatives to deletion}

Among major social media platforms, YouTube's recent policy relating
to election or census misinformation is the only other example where
false claims would be removed because of their falsehood. The
platforms all otherwise resort to less intrusive alternatives:
downrank, flag or label, and promote more accurate
content.◊note-see["Persily" #:parenthetical "presents demotion,
disclosure, delay, dilution and diversion, deterrence, and digital
literacy as alternatives to deletion"]

◊heading{The harms of misinformation}

◊q{ Force, and fraud, are in war the two cardinal virtues. --- Thomas
Hobbes }

Misinformation causes both ◊em{societal} and ◊em{individual} harm. At
the societal level, misinformation can result in "distortion of
democratic discourse," "manipulation of elections," "erosion of trust
in significant public and private institutions," "enhancement and
exploitation of social divisions," and "threats to the
economy."◊note{◊cite["Citron" #:pinpoint "1777ff" #:parenthetical
"discussing deep fakes specifically, but these harms stem from
disinformation generally"]} Misinformation sows seeds of doubt,
mistrust, and a "cascade of cynicism" that spreads from particular
sources to media and experts in general.◊note-see["Verstraete"
#:parenthetical "presenting the doubt, mistrust, and “cascade of
cynicism” that spreads from particular sources to media and experts
generally"] Misinformation also creates direct harms to
individuals. At the low end, this might be misinformation as innocuous
as "keeping your cellphone charged at 100% will extend its battery
life." But it also includes much more consequential misinformation
that can cause people to waste time and money on medical treatments
that do nothing or even worsen a prognosis.◊note-cite["Novella: What's
the Harm"]

In this article, I present a hypothesis that the major social media
platforms are operating under a ◊em{Charter}-like approach to free
expression that balances free expression against these harms caused by
misinformation. COVID-19 misinformation apparently meets the
platforms' threshold for intervention. This raises the further
question: what other misinformation might also meet this threshold?

YouTube has already targeted a small category of democratic-process
misinformation.◊note{◊see["Miller" #:parenthetical "discussed above,
in the text accompanying note 36"]} Protecting the integrity of the
political process from the harms of misinformation has also been
recognized in Canada as a justification for infringing the right to
free expression.◊note-see["Harper" #:parenthetical "the Court allowed
a blackout period on election advertising in order to allow response
to “potentially misleading election advertising”"]

I've presented the general harms of misinformation above, but I
present next a small list of misinformation that is particularly and
demonstrably harmful in diverse ways.

Misleading health claims can give patients and families false hope,
they can lead patients to forego effective treatment or to undergo
interventions that carry risk with no benefit.◊note-see["Novella:
What's the Harm"] When the proper treatment has societal benefits
(vaccination, for example), following the misinformation leads to
societal harms.◊note-see["Benecke"]

Conspiracy theories are another category of misinformation. These take
advantage of a psychological need to explain, to control, and to feel
like you're on the "inside."◊note-see["Douglas: Conspiracy"]
Conspiracy theories certainly overlap with the category of misleading
health claims. Some anti-vaccination theories involve a claim that
vaccines are dangerous yet recommended ◊em{because} of "secret and
malevolent forces."◊note-cite["Douglas: Chapter" #:pinpoint "184"]
Another example of overlap is the conspiracy theory that HIV is not
the cause of AIDS.◊note-cite["Douglas: Chapter" #:pinpoint "188"] But
they also influence how people receive information about
socially-important issues like climate change.◊note-cite["Douglas:
Chapter" #:pinpoint "188"] And conspiracy theories are associated with
racist attitudes, although the direction of causation has not been
established.◊note-cite["Douglas: Chapter" #:pinpoint "188--89"]

Another kind of harmful misinformation may simply be fraud. This
includes financial hoaxsters, multi-level marketing
schemes,◊note-see["Cunha"] and even the peddling of "organized
pseudolegal commercial arguments" (freemen-on-the-land or
sovereign-citizen theories).◊note-cite["Meads"] This latter category
has "proven disruptive, inflict[s] unnecessary expenses on other
parties, and [is] ultimately harmful to the persons who appear in
court and attempt to invoke these vexatious
strategies."◊note-cite["Meads" #:pinpoint "para 71"]

Misinformation and its harm is as old as speech
itself,◊note-cite["Persily" #:pinpoint "4"] but online misinformation
has additional characteristics that increase the risk and extent of
that harm, including speed, virality, and
anonymity.◊note-see["Persily" #:pinpoint "5"] Platforms may very well
be able to decrease the impact of misinformation by targeting these
force multipliers rather than the misinformation directly.

◊heading{An emerging balance}

As non-government entities, social media platforms are not subject to
the constraints of the First Amendment or s. 2(b) of the
◊em{Charter}.◊note-see-generally["Eldridge"] They in fact ◊em{benefit}
from the right to free expression to secure their own freedom to
govern expression on their platforms as they see
fit.◊note{◊see["Keller" #:parenthetical "“private platforms aren’t
really the public square, and internet companies aren’t governments”"
#:terminal ";"] ◊cite["Newton" #:parenthetical "“most people want
[Facebook] to go much further than the First Amendment”" #:terminal
";"] ◊cite["Klonick" #:pinpoint "1626" #:parenthetical "“you get to
decide what the tone and tenor of your platform look[] like, and
that's a First Amendment right in and of itself”"]} But, it is still
revealing to examine what free-expression values are reflected in the
policies adopted by social media platforms.

The platforms' actions until now have appeared to reflect liberal
First Amendment values and a "reductionist" conception of
harm.◊note-cite["Kang" #:pinpoint "para 15"] Platforms' proactive
treatment of COVID-19 misinformation, in the absence of government
regulation or obvious market pressures, reveals that the First
Amendment isn't the whole story. There is a communitarian or
egalitarian aspect to their self-governance as well. Or if I am wrong
about the motivations, their actions today at least reveal that there
is space for such a communitarian or egalitarian aspect.

◊sub-heading{A First Amendment Perspective}

The US Supreme Court has interpreted the First Amendment to only allow
content-based restrictions within a narrow list of
traditionally-recognized categories: "incitement of imminent lawless
action," obscenity, defamation, child pornography, speech "integral to
criminal conduct," fighting words, fraud, true threats, and "speech
presenting some grave an imminent threat the government has the power
to prevent."◊note{◊cite["Alvarez" #:pinpoint "717" #:terminal ""],
citing ◊cite["Brandenburg" #:parenthetical "imminent lawless action"
#:terminal ";"] ◊cite["Miller" #:parenthetical "obscenity" #:terminal
";"] ◊cite["NYT" #:parenthetical "defamation" #:terminal ";"]
◊cite["Giboney" #:parenthetical "speech integral to criminal conduct"
#:terminal ";"] ◊cite["Chaplinsky" #:parenthetical "fighting words"
#:terminal ";"] ◊cite["Ferber" #:parenthetical "child pornography"
#:terminal ";"] ◊cite["VA Pharmacy" #:parenthetical "fraud" #:terminal
";"] ◊cite["Watts" #:parenthetical "true threats" #:terminal ";"] and
◊cite["Near" #:parenthetical "grave and imminent threat..."]} The
Court has explicitly noted that "absent from those few
categories... is any general exception to the First Amendment for
false statements"; "erroneous statement is inevitable in free
debate."◊note-cite["Alvarez" #:pinpoint "718"] The Court ◊em{has},
however, placed less value false statements, but always in the context
of some other "legally cognizable harm."◊note-cite["Alvarez"
#:pinpoint "718--719"] Where the Court has allowed a content-based
distinction that would treat false statements differently than true
statements, it has been in one of two contexts: commercial
speech◊note{The US Supreme Court initially held that advertising was
not protected by the First Amendment. ◊see["Valentine"]} or falsehood
plus harm. And for non-commercial false speech, a remedy is only
available to a person harmed after such harm has occurred: there are
no prior restraints on non-commercial false statements.

The United States Supreme Court has also "rejected as startling and
dangerous a free-floating test for First Amendment coverage based on
an ad hoc balancing of relative social costs and
benefits."◊note{◊cite["Alvarez" #:pinpoint "717" #:terminal " (cleaned
up)"], citing ◊cite["Stevens"]} Note that there is no analogue of
Section 1 of the ◊em{Charter} in the US Constitution. Thus, the entire
issue is generally framed in terms of First Amendment "coverage":
e.g. does the First Amendment cover obscenity? The Supreme Court of
Canada instead has given s. 2(b) of the ◊em{Charter} the broadest
possible conception, protecting any attempt to convey
meaning.◊note-see["Irwin Toy"] (This does, however, excludes violence
and threats of violence.◊note-see["Khawaja" #:pinpoint "para 17"])
Whether something like obscenity can be prohibited by the government
is framed in Canada as a question of whether the infringement of the
right to free expression can be justified under s. 1 of the
◊em{Charter}. This exercise is infused with a balancing of "social
costs"◊note-cite["Whatcott"] and benefits.◊note{◊see["Oakes"
#:terminal ";"] ◊cite["Dagenais" #:terminal ";"] ◊cite["RJR"
#:pinpoint "para 62" #:parenthetical "“[t]he s. 1 inquiry is an
unavoidably normative inquiry”"]}

Platforms have hewed closely to First Amendment ideals, although
straying slightly with respect to several categories of
content.◊note-see-eg["Facebook's Community Standards" #:parenthetical
"listing (among other things) violence and incitement, promotion of
crime, fraud, child nudity and sexual exploitation, harassment and
intimidation, obscenity as content that will be deleted"] These
departures are best explained as a response to foreign regulation and
market pressures rather than a reasoned balancing of harm and
expression: "It's no coincidence that YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and
Microsoft, which earn substantial portions of their revenues in
Europe, apply European hate-speech standards globally—even in
countries where that speech is legal."◊note-cite["Keller"]

Until now though, platforms have resisted pressure to police
misinformation. Mark Zuckerberg has said:

◊q{ [M]isinformation, I think is really tricky... everyone would
basically agree that you don’t want the content that’s getting the
most distribution to be flagrant hoaxes that are tricking people. But
the other side... is that a lot of people express their life and their
experiences by telling stories, and sometimes the stories are true and
sometimes they’re not. And people use satire and they use fiction
... and the question is, how do you differentiate and draw the line
between satire or a fictional story? Where is the
line?◊note{◊cite["Newton"] This quote also reflects a vision of free
expression that is focused on individual liberty and "self-expressive
rights of the singular speaker." ◊cite["Syed" #:pinpoint "341"]}}

But wherever that line might be, COVID-19 misinformation is across
that line for these platforms. This reveals that platforms are
operating under a vision closer to that from Canada's ◊em{Charter}
than that from the First Amendment.

◊sub-heading{A ◊em{Charter} Perspective}

Some previous restrictions of misinformation by the platforms may
appear at first as an adoption of a ◊em{Charter} perspective, but
these previous restrictions have been consistent with the narrow
exceptions that the US Supreme Court has carved out from First
Amendment protection. For example, platforms have generally not
allowed misleading or deceptive advertisement.◊note-see-eg["Google
Misrepresentation"] This reflects a conception of free expression that
places less value on commercial or profit-motivated
speech.◊note{◊see-eg["Valentine" #:terminal ";"] ◊cite["VA Pharmacy"]
Profit-motivated speech also holds less value under a s. 1
justification in Canada. ◊see["Irwin Toy" #:parenthetical "“harm
engendered by tobacco and the profit motive underlying its promotion
place this form of expression as far from the 'core' of freedom of
expression values”"]}

But, the new policies of Twitter, Facebook, Google, and YouTube with
respect to COVID-19 misinformation amount to a prior restraint (within
each platform) on non-commercial misinformation, before any legally
cognizable harm has occurred. This is wholly inconsistent with a First
Amendment-inspired lens on the role of free expression. While prior
constraints are viewed with particular skepticism by Canadian
courts,◊note-see["Little Sisters"] they are not out of the question,
and courts will consider the balance of the "social costs and
benefits"◊note-cite["Stevens"] that US law avoids.

As presented above, COVID-19 is just the latest subject of
misinformation, yet platforms have adopted unusually proactive and
strict measures to delete it. When we look at the ◊em{social costs}
side of the ledger in Canadian jurisprudence, we find a plethora of
factors can explain the platforms' differential treatment of COVID-19
misinformation, particularly in the s. 1 analysis. To justify an
infringement of a ◊em{Charter} right, s. 1 requires the government to
identify a pressing and substantial objective and to demonstrate that
the means chosen to achieve that objective are proportional (further
requiring that the government demonstrate that the means are
rationally connected to the objective, that the means are minimally
impairing, and that the deleterious effects do not outweigh the
salutary effects of the measure).◊note{◊see["Oakes"]
◊see-also["Dagenais"]}

At the highest level, a s. 1 analysis of infringements of the right to
free expression adopts a "communitarian understanding of the
harms."◊note-see["Kang"] It matters that the harms may be suffered by
vulnerable groups.◊note-see["Irwin Toy" #:parenthetical "the *Consumer
Protection Act* regulated advertising that was directed at young
children"] Even the dissent in ◊em{Irwin Toy} (which would have struck
down a prohibition on advertising directed at children) said that
restrictions could be justified for the "protection of the
community."◊note-cite["Irwin Toy" #:pinpoint "1009"] A "social
nuisance" has been sufficient to justify a s. 2(b)
infringement.◊note-see["Prostitution reference" #:parenthetical "“the
public display of the sale of sex”"] The Court has approved of a
restriction on advertising that was "likely to create an erroneous
impression about the characteristics, health effects, or health hazard
[of tobacco]."◊note-cite["JTI" #:parenthetical "albeit, this was in
the context of commercial, profit-motivated speech"] "Avoidance of
harm to society" was an objective that justified criminal obscenity
law.◊note-cite["Butler"] "[C]ourts must determine as best they can
what the community would tolerate others being exposed to on the basis
of the degree of harm that may flow from such
exposure."◊note-cite["Butler"] To the extent that there is uncertainty
about the harmful effects of misinformation,◊note-see["Guess"] s. 1
jurisprudence has not demanded evidential certainty in order to
justify an infringement. The Court in ◊em{R. v. Butler} explicitly
relied on "inconclusive social science evidence."◊note-cite["Butler"]

The approach that platforms have taken to COVID-19 misinformation can
be explained through this s. 1 lens. Our collective response to
COVID-19 is rooted in a communitarian understanding of its harms. We
are not self-isolating because we may personally get sick; we are
self-isolating in order to deny the virus a vector for
transmission. This is why platforms are combatting misinformation that
would lead to people violating isolation guidelines. Facebook has even
gone so far to take down pages that organize protests that "defy
government's guidance on social distancing."◊note-cite["Wong"] It also
appears that these harms may be suffered more by vulnerable
groups.◊note-see["Kendi"] While there is disagreement and uncertainty
about fine details and forecasts, public health authorities are
largely in agreement about the big picture on COVID-19: it exists, it
is caused by a virus, it spreads through close human--human
interaction, and risk of spread is reduced maintaining physical
distance, avoiding touching one's face, washing one's hands, and
wearing a mask.◊note{◊see-eg["CDC-Masks" #:terminal ";"]
◊cite["WHO-Masks" #:terminal ";"] ◊cite["BC-Masks"]} This gives
platforms a set of authoritative sources, deviation from which the
community is not willing to tolerate. And our COVID-19 response has
been likened to a war, which can elicit a statist deference to
authority.◊note{This imagery has been criticized, specifically because
of this statist response that it elicits, and the heightened risks to
which we might be willing to expose "frontline"
workers. ◊see-eg["Serhan"]} All of these factors are evocative of
those that the Canadian government has previously relied upon (or that
courts have alluded to) to justify infringements of the right to free
expression.

Despite the claims I've made in this section, I acknowledge there may
be a more cynical explanation for the change in tack by the platforms
towards COVID-19 disinformation. The leadership within these companies
may simply feel more personally vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19
misinformation. We see throughout history that response to harm is
often delayed until that harm is felt by the powerful. For example,
with respect to protections against unreasonable search and seizure,
"[s]ocial attitudes toward vagrants as an unworthy underclass delayed
resentment of such searches until other more esteemed members of
society were subjected to them."◊note{◊cite["Cuddihy"]

It is one thing for a social media platform to voluntarily adopt
measures to combat harmful misinformation, but could our government
directly or indirectly control this speech? Such control could take
several forms spanning from a criminal offence that targets speakers
to regulation that is directed at social media platforms.◊note{A
separate question is whether such government regulation would nudge
platforms toward more expansive self-regulation and a more inclusive
conception of harm, or whether government regulation would give
platforms an anchor point, beyond which platforms would not feel any
need to intervene.}

The ◊em{Criminal Code} formerly made it a crime to spread false news:

◊q{

Every one who wilfully publishes a statement, tale or news that he
knows is false and that causes or is likely to cause injury or
mischief to a public interest is guilty of an indictable offence and
liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two
years.◊note{◊cite["CC" #:pinpoint "s 181" #:terminal ","] repealed by
◊cite["C-25"]}

}

In ◊em{R v. Zundel},◊note-cite["Zundel"] the Supreme Court of Canada
(splitting 4--3) held that the false-news offence was
unconstitutional. The majority (written by Justice McLachlin, as she
then was) re-affirmed that s. 2(b) of the ◊em{Charter} protects
deliberate lies. Deliberate lies are a form of expression. And it
isn't the case, as was argued by the government, that "deliberate lies
can never have value." The majority also identified that it would be
difficult to determine with sufficient certainty the meaning of a
particular expression and then determine whether it is false.

Given that s. 181 infringed Zundel's freedom of expression, the
question turned to whether the government could justify that
infringement under s. 1 of the ◊em{Charter}.

The Court held that the government failed to identify a pressing and
substantial objective to which the false-news offence was
directed. They saw it as a hold-over from the Statute of Westminster
in 1275, enacted as part of Canada's ◊em{Criminal Code} in 1892 with
no explanation. They found no evidence that Parliament had retained it
through until today to address any particular social problem. And even
if they were to have accepted one of the submitted
purposes,◊note{Three purposes were submitted: "to protect matters that
rise to a level of public interest from being jeopardized by false
speech" (by the Crown), "to further racial and social tolerance" (by
the Canadian Jewish Congress, an intervener), and "to ensure that
meaningful public discussion is not tainted by the deleterious effects
of the wilful publication of falsehoods which case, or are likely to
cause, damage to public interests, to the detriment of public order"
(by the Attorney General for Canada, an intervener).} they would have
found the offence to be overbroad and thus not minimally impairing. A
particular concern was the chilling effect created by the vagueness
and overbreadth of the offence. Finally, it was significant that this
was a criminal offence, which demands a higher degree of
justification.◊note-see["Irwin Toy"]

On April 15, 2020, Dominic LeBlanc, President of the Privy Council
said that the government is "considering introducing legislation to
make it an offence to knowingly spread misinformation that could harm
people."◊note-cite["Thompson"] This seems like it would simply be a
re-enactment of the unconstitutional s. 181.

But a new ◊em{Fake News Act} wouldn't necessarily suffer the same fate
as s. 181. Parliament could make clear the new purpose of the law,
something that was missing in ◊em{Zundel}. They could confine its
period of application to a particular emergency. They could restrict
it to apply to a narrow category of specific claims instead of "any
false news or tale whereby injury of mischief is or is likely to be
occasioned to any public interest."◊note{◊cite["CC" #:pinpoint "s 181"
#:terminal " (repealed)."]} And this would not need to be part of the
◊em{Criminal Code}. For example, it could empower the Canadian
Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) rather than
prosecutors. Social media platforms contribute to the viral spread of
misinformation and thus to the misinformation's harm. A ◊em{Fake News
Act} could target platforms rather than individual speakers (who would
be left free to make their false claims on personal blogs).

From a federalism perspective, this would be within the jurisdiction
of the federal government either through its control of
telecommunications and broadcasting (if it targets platforms), or it
could be within the emergency-powers branch of federal jurisdiction
over peace, order, and good government.

While a ◊em{Fake News Act} like I just described would absolutely
infringe the s. 2(b) right to free expression, it would have a better
shot at justification under s. 1 than the former ◊em{Criminal Code}
s. 181. In order to be justified under s. 1, the infringement would
have to be a "reasonable limit[] prescribed by law as can be
demonstrably justified in a free and democratic
society."◊note-cite["Charter" #:pinpoint "s 1"]

Before embarking on the heart of the s. 1 analysis, it is important to
characterize the harm being targeted and the nature of the right
affected. This characterization is critical to a proper application of
s. 1.◊note{◊see["RJR" #:pinpoint "para 71" #:terminal ":"] “Turning
now to the nature of the right infringed under the Act, it is once
again necessary to place the appellants' claim in context. This Court
has recognized, in a line of freedom of expression cases dating back
to Edmonton Journal, supra, that, depending on its nature, expression
will be entitled to varying levels of constitutional protection.” ...
“While the Canadian approach does not apply special tests to
restrictions on commercial expression, our method of analysis does
permit a sensitive, case-oriented approach to the determination of
their constitutionality. Placing the conflicting values in their
factual and social context when performing the s. 1 analysis permits
the courts to have regard to special features of the expression in
question... not all expression is equally worthy of protection. Nor
are all infringements of free expression equally serious.”} The
characterization will inform the proportionality prong of the
◊em{Oakes} test, but it will also tune the "margin of appreciation"
that the legislature is due and set the appropriate "standard of
justification" throughout the analysis.

Even if directed at platforms, there are two possible conceptions of
the right being affected. One view is that this would be targeting
the commercial or profit-motivated aspect of speech that is not even
the platform's own expression. The Court would be likely to view this
expression as lower-value expression and apply the s. 1 analysis more
leniently for the government.

On the other hand, the Court may not read much into the formal
distinction that it is the platform being targeted. In
◊em{R. v. Guignard}, there was a bylaw that prohibited people from
"advertising" using signs (including counter-advertising) in certain
areas of the city.◊note-cite["Guignard"] The Court recognized that the
bylaw effectively restricted Guignard to "virtually private
communications such as distributing leaflets in the neighborhood
around his property."◊note-cite["Guignard" #:pinpoint "para 30"] A
user whose speech is removed by a platform has the option of posting
on their personal blog with still worldwide reach, but this might be
akin to "virtually private communications such as distributing
leaflets." If content is blocked from social media platforms, "then
the content would effectively not exist."◊note-cite["Citron:
Censorship Creep" #:pinpoint "1056"]

Much of the s. 1 analysis will depend on whether the restrictions
directed at the platforms amount to merely taking away a
megaphone◊note-see["Haig" #:parenthetical "the “megaphone” metaphor
was used in a different context"] or restricting users to virtually
private communications.

The Court would almost certainly accept that the Act has a
pressing and substantial objective: to combat the society-wide harms
associated with non-compliance caused by COVID-19 misinformation that
is spread easily through major social media platforms. These harms are
presented above, and the Court has generally adopted a fairly
permissive approach at this stage of the s. 1 analysis.

The government would also be likely able to demonstrate a rational
connection between the regulation and the objective. It does seem
straightforward that directing platforms to delete COVID-19
misinformation would reduce belief in that misinformation. But, the
effect of misinformation may not have as large a magnitude as is often
attributed to it,◊note-see["Lazer"] and evidence suggests that other
strategies like ◊em{corrective} information or labelling fake news may
not yield intuitive results.◊note-see["Clayton"] I am not aware of any
empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of post-publication
deletion of false claims, let alone in the context where this deletion
is likely incomplete (posts will get through the cracks). Even in
light of this social science uncertainty though, the Court has
accepted that "[t]he government must show that it is reasonable to
suppose that the limit may further the goal, not that it will do
so."◊note-cite["Hutterian" #:pinpoint "para 48"] "Where the court is
faced with inconclusive or competing social science evidence relating
the harm to the legislature’s measures, the court may rely on a
reasoned apprehension of that harm."◊note-cite["Harper" #:pinpoint
"para 77"]

Whether a new ◊em{Fake News Act} would be viewed as minimally
impairing would depend on how narrowly the prohibition is tailored and
applied in practice. If it is time-limited, restricted to specific,
pre-identified COVID-19 misinformation (so as to not be overbroad),
applying only to large social media platforms (so as to only remove a
megaphone, not gag the speakers), it would be more likely to be seen
as minimally impairing. It would also need to be demonstrated that
lesser alternatives would not meaningfully achieve the government's
objective. Platforms and the government ◊em{do} have lesser
alternatives that they use for non-COVID-19 misinformation. This would
cut against the government's assertion that deletion orders would be
minimally impairing.

It would also have to be seen whether such a regime would be
administered in a manner that respects a narrow tailoring. To
determine whether something is a false claim, it "must be seen in its
entirety, with close attention to context, tone, and purpose. A work
that may appear to be [false (originally, obscenity)] may in fact be a
biting political satire or critique."◊note-cite["Little Sisters"
#:parenthetical "discussing obscenity, not false news" #:judge
"Iacobucci, J (dissenting in part)" #:pinpoint "para 238"]

The final balancing of the salutary and deleterious effects of a
◊em{Fake News Act} will depend on its form and on the Court's
conception of the speech that it is targeting. If it targets platforms
through the CRTC, it may be seen as significantly less deleterious
than the previous s. 181 of the ◊em{Criminal Code}, especially if the
opportunity to publish elsewhere is seen as a meaningful alternative
for speakers. But if alternative avenues for speech actually are
meaningful alternatives for speakers, this may decrease the Act's
salutary effects, since the expression would still be entering the
world.

A ◊em{Fake News Act} may be able to strike this balance. But given the
fine line that such an act would have to toe, it is unlikely that
outside of a discrete emergency with identifiable and imminently
harmful misinformation ◊em{requiring} suppression (as opposed to
lesser alternatives like flagging) would our government be able to
control misinformation through legislation. While I have presented
this as a possibility, I admit it is hard to imagine just what
expression might meet this hurdle.

◊heading{Conclusion}

Platforms have appropriately shifted towards a ◊em{Charter}-like
perspective on free expression, revealed most acutely in their
decision to delete COVID-19 misinformation. If platforms view as a
serious responsibility the task of balancing free expression against
harm, this implies that more areas of misinformation may soon be
subject to platform oversight, especially false and harmful health
claims. And, Parliament may even be able to require such platform
oversight in discrete emergencies where there is identifiable and
imminently harmful misinformation.
