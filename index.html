<p>Devante Parker does a double-move at about step 5, faking an inside/dig, but just for one step, then continues with his go route.</p>

<p>Amari Cooper runs a short hitch. Three full strides, then chops his steps to stop and change direction.</p>

<p>Amari Cooper runs a 10 step curl. Comes out of the acceleration a few steps early, then chops steps to stop and change direction. </p>
<div class="gfyitem" data-autoplay=false data-controls=true data-expand=false data-id="PoisedAccurateHoki" ></div>

<p>Amari Cooper runs a flat route. Changes direction almost 90° on step 3 with no wasted steps.</p>
<div class="gfyitem" data-autoplay=false data-controls=true data-expand=false data-id="SomeSmoggyHoki" ></div>

<p>Amari Cooper runs a corner route. Gets room by running inside, then changes direction with one jab step.</p>
<div class="gfyitem" data-autoplay=false data-controls=true data-expand=false data-id="TotalShadyAoudad" ></div>

<p>Devin Funchess runs a stop-and-go. Chopped steps to come out of his 6-step acceleration.</p>
<div class="gfyitem" data-autoplay=false data-controls=true data-expand=false data-id="CautiousSoftFinnishspitz" ></div>

<p>Julio Jones runs an out route on Josh Norman. Accelerates about 8 steps, then starts to lower his centre of gravity to prep for the out. Takes a few steps to come to a stop and stays low through the direction change.</p>
<div class="gfyitem" data-autoplay=false data-controls=true data-expand=false data-id="PracticalSoreIguana" ></div>

<p>Antonio Brown stop-and-go. Chops steps to fake a hitch at about 5 steps.</p>
<div class="gfyitem" data-autoplay=false data-controls=true data-expand=false data-id="ShowyFrailFurseal" ></div>

<p>Antonio Brown hitch or something. Comes up out of his acceleration between steps 3 and 4. Step 5 he plants his right foot hard and changes direction to the outside.</p>
<div class="gfyitem" data-autoplay=false data-controls=true data-expand=false data-id="DisguisedEasyDoe" ></div>
<div class="gfyitem" data-autoplay=false data-controls=true data-expand=false data-id="AjarOrneryIcelandichorse" ></div>

<p>Stefon Diggs out and go. Changes direction about 70° with a single step twice. Neither is at top speed. He comes up out of his acceleration a few steps before the first direction change.</p>
<div class="gfyitem" data-autoplay=false data-controls=true data-expand=false data-id="PoliteCavernousAstrangiacoral" ></div>

<p>Stefon Diggs out route. From the first indication that Diggs is coming out of his acceleration, the 90° turn takes about 7 yards of vertical field space. This is typical of an out route. The hard jab step that sets it up doesn't take away all of the up-field momentum.</p>
