              <h4>Spatially local coding</h4>
              <p><a href="assets/toptens.png"><img src="assets/toptens-150x150.png" alt="Visualization of features" title="Spatially local coding visualization" width="150" height="150" class="align-left" /></a> The spatial pyramid and its variants have been among the most popular and successful models for object recognition. To create a spatial pyramid representation of an image, you need to encode local visual features as elements of a visual vocabulary and then pool these encoded features into histograms at several spatial granularities. In this project, we introduce spatially local coding, an alternative way to include spatial information in the image model. Instead of only coding visual appearance and leaving the spatial coherence to be represented by the pooling stage, we include location as part of the coding step. This is a more flexible spatial representation as compared to the fixed grids used in the spatial pyramid models and we can use a simple, whole-image region during the pooling stage. On the Caltech 101 and 256 object recognition datasets, this model performs better than all previous single-feature methods.</p>

              <h4>Local Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor</h4>
              <p><a href="assets/Manifold-e1333591359916.png"><img src="assets/Manifold-e1333591359916-150x150.png" alt="" title="Local Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor" width="150" height="150" class="align-left" /></a> Local Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor improves upon the NBNN image classification algorithm. It increases classification accuracy and allows NBNN to scale to large numbers of object classes. We observed that in NBNN, only the classes with features in the local neighborhood of a descriptor get significant and reliable updates to their posterior probabilities. Instead of maintaining a separate search structure for each class, we merge all of the reference data together into one search structure, allowing quick identification of a descriptor's local neighborhood across all classes. By ignoring adjustments to the more distant classes, local NBNN gives higher classification accuracy and its run time grows with the log of the number of classes rather than linearly. This gives a 100 times speed-up over original NBNN on the Caltech 256 dataset. We also show the first head-to-head comparisons of NBNN against spatial pyramid methods using a common set of input features. We found that local NBNN outperforms all previous NBNN based methods and the original spatial pyramid model. However, local NBNN does not beat state-of-the-art spatial pyramid methods that use local soft assignment and max-pooling.</p>

I developed a rule-based behaviour system for finding, approaching, and kicking the ball. I manually tuned the walking gait using custom software. Abarenbou was our entry in the 2005 FIRA RoboWorld Cup.</p>

              <p><a href="assets/airplane.png"><img class="align-left" title="airplane" src="assets/airplane.png" alt="" width="150" /></a>During my last term at the University of Manitoba, a small group of us assembled to form the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle team. We prepared an entry to the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International's student competition. Our goal was to have our airplane take-off, fly a search pattern, and land. All autonomously. While in the search area, a video feed was fed to an ground-based observing station, where an observer was to mark targets of interest and report their coordinates. Grading was based on accomplishing the mission autonomously, and the accuracy of our coordinates. We found good teammates, advisors, and sponsors. We placed 1st out of 17 teams in a field that included BYU, University of Texas, Cornell, MIT, and UCSD. I wrote much of the computer vision code, transforming the video's pixel coordinates to GPS coordinates, and giving that information to the observer in an easy to use interface.</p>

Relationships between temperature, dewpoint, and the lifting of imaginary parcels of air help people predict soaring conditions, atmospheric stability, and the likelihood of severe weather. The existing diagrams that display these relationships have been described as the most difﬁcult atmospheric diagrams to read. The re-design uses well tested information visualization principles to show data to the user that was previously hidden behind lines and frames. This not only helps readers see the information on individual charts, but allows them to more easily compare between multiple charts. I hope that AtmosView can help people with an amateur interest in these meteorological relationships.</p>
