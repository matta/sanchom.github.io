◊title{LSAT 83, Logic Games, Question 4}

I think this is close to how I diagrammed it on the test day. I
haven't tried any alternative diagrams or splitting choices and I
don't claim this is a great way to do this, but it worked for me.◊margin-note{I
only got the acceptable situation question wrong but I have no idea
what led me to choose Ⓑ (second and third floor on the same day)!}

I represented this as a sequencing game with two spots per day. It
looks like a 2-layer sequencing game, but there is no significance to
the order of items on a particular day. They are interchangable.

I first split the game board based on the rule that 4 has to go on
Thursday or Friday.

◊margin-note{I represented rule ① visually by drawing a few examples
of the pairings that aren't allowed, but I didn't write out every
single prohibited combination. This is part of what makes this game
difficult. You have to keep this general prohibition in mind
throughout the game, and it is essential to narrowing down the options
later on.}◊margin-note{I've also combined two rules into 3--7--5 and
just crossed off rule ④ because it's completely represented in the
split gameboard.} ◊img[#:src "assets/lsat-83-lg-q4-1.png"]

Three things come together next to severely shrink the number of
possible worlds. We have the 3--7--5 sequence. We have two game
boards: one with a 4 on a Thursday and one with 4 on a Friday. We know
that 3/4 can't go together and 4/5 can't go together.

When 4 is on a Thursday, 3 is forced onto Wednesday. When 4 is on a
Friday, 5 is forced onto Saturday.

◊margin-note{Based purely on the 3--7--5 sequencing rule, the latest 3
can go is Thursday. But even that isn't allowed if 4 is already on
Thursday (3/4 is prohibited). 3 must go on Wednesday if 4 is already on
Thursday.}◊img[#:src "assets/lsat-83-lg-q4-2.png"]

Next, I split each of these worlds into three subworlds, for the three
possible arrangements of the remaining two elements of the 3--7--5
sequence.

◊margin-note{Rule ③ is now completely represented on the game boards.}
◊img[#:src "assets/lsat-83-lg-q4-4.png"]

Several of these game boards severely restrict the placement of the
2--8 sequence, given that 2 cannot go on the same day as 3.

◊margin-note{On the game boards where the placement of the 2--8
sequence is determined (bottom four game boards), I just wrote them
in. This also almost completely determined the placement of the
floaters, 1 and 6. I also wrote them in where I could.}◊margin-note{On
the top two boards, 2--8 is not as heavily constrained, so I just
moved the rule close to the boards along with the two floaters, 1 and
6.}◊margin-note{When considering the top two game boards, I did need
to continually remind myself that 2/3, 5/6, 7/8 were not allowed This
slowed me down.}◊img[#:src "assets/lsat-83-lg-q4-5.png"]

That was my diagram when I went into the questions.
