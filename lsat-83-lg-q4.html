    <root><h1 hyphens="none">LSAT 83, Logic Games, Question 4</h1><p>I think this is close to how I di­a­grammed it on the test day. I haven’t tried any al­ter­na­tive di­a­grams or split­ting choic­es and I don’t claim this is a great way to do this, but it worked for me.<span><label for="3018982540" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="3018982540" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="155758789" class="margin-expand"/><label for="155758789" class="margin-note expanded" hyphens="none">I only got the acceptable situation question wrong but I have no idea what led me to choose Ⓑ (second and third floor on the same day)!</label></span></p><p>I rep­re­sent­ed this as a se­quenc­ing game with two spots per day. It looks like a 2-lay­er se­quenc­ing game, but there is no significance to the or­der of items on a par­tic­u­lar day. They are in­ter­changable.</p><p>I first split the game board based on the rule that 4 has to go on Thursday or Friday.</p><p><span><label for="1515039028" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="1515039028" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="4243185608" class="margin-expand"/><label for="4243185608" class="margin-note expanded" hyphens="none">I represented rule ① visually by drawing a few examples of the pairings that aren’t allowed, but I didn’t write out every single prohibited combination. This is part of what makes this game difficult. You have to keep this general prohibition in mind throughout the game, and it is essential to narrowing down the options later on.</label></span><span><label for="542728971" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="542728971" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="2317824872" class="margin-expand"/><label for="2317824872" class="margin-note expanded" hyphens="none">I’ve also combined two rules into 3–7–5 and just crossed off rule ④ because it’s completely represented in the split gameboard.</label></span> <img src="assets/lsat-83-lg-q4-1.png"/></p><p>Three things come to­geth­er next to se­vere­ly shrink the num­ber of pos­si­ble worlds. We have the 3–7–5 se­quence. We have two game boards: one with a 4 on a Thursday and one with 4 on a Friday. We know that 3/4 can’t go to­geth­er and 4/5 can’t go to­geth­er.</p><p>When 4 is on a Thursday, 3 is forced onto Wednesday. When 4 is on a Friday, 5 is forced onto Saturday.</p><p><span><label for="3466817782" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="3466817782" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="3427930838" class="margin-expand"/><label for="3427930838" class="margin-note expanded" hyphens="none">Based purely on the 3–7–5 sequencing rule, the latest 3 can go is Thursday. But even that isn’t allowed if 4 is already on Thursday (3/4 is prohibited). 3 must go on Wednesday if 4 is already on Thursday.</label></span><img src="assets/lsat-83-lg-q4-2.png"/></p><p>Next, I split each of these worlds into three sub­worlds, for the three pos­si­ble arrange­ments of the re­main­ing two el­e­ments of the 3–7–5 se­quence.</p><p><span><label for="447255631" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="447255631" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="3660593548" class="margin-expand"/><label for="3660593548" class="margin-note expanded" hyphens="none">Rule ③ is now completely represented on the game boards.</label></span> <img src="assets/lsat-83-lg-q4-4.png"/></p><p>Several of these game boards se­vere­ly re­strict the place­ment of the 2–8 se­quence, giv­en that 2 can­not go on the same day as 3.</p><p><span><label for="3461036746" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="3461036746" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="1000343270" class="margin-expand"/><label for="1000343270" class="margin-note expanded" hyphens="none">On the game boards where the placement of the 2–8 sequence is determined (bottom four game boards), I just wrote them in. This also almost completely determined the placement of the floaters, 1 and 6. I also wrote them in where I could.</label></span><span><label for="3653565658" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="3653565658" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="2835651482" class="margin-expand"/><label for="2835651482" class="margin-note expanded" hyphens="none">On the top two boards, 2–8 is not as heavily constrained, so I just moved the rule close to the boards along with the two floaters, 1 and 6.</label></span><span><label for="3691130222" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="3691130222" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="3043558667" class="margin-expand"/><label for="3043558667" class="margin-note expanded" hyphens="none">When considering the top two game boards, I did need to continually remind myself that 2/3, 5/6, 7/8 were not allowed This slowed me down.</label></span><img src="assets/lsat-83-lg-q4-5.png"/></p><p>That was my di­a­gram when I went into the ques­tions.</p><div class="endnotes print-only"></div></root>
