I am a computer scientist interested in object recognition, machine
learning, and applications of deep neural networks.  I finished my
Ph.D. at the University of British Columbia in April 2014 and was
supervised by ◊a[#:href "http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/"]{David Lowe}.

◊h4{Spatially local coding}
◊thumbnail[#:big "assets/toptens.png" #:small "assets/toptens-150x150.png"]{}
This method for classifying images takes features that have been
extracted from a training dataset and groups them into clusters that
are similar in appearance and location.

More details, code: ◊b-link[#:word "project-page"]{http://www.cs.ubc.ca/projects/spatially-local-coding}

◊h4{Local Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor}
Local Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor improves upon the NBNN image
classification algorithm. Local NBNN gives higher classification
accuracy and runs 100 times faster than NBNN on the Caltech 256
dataset.

◊h4{Humanoid Robot}
◊thumbnail[#:big "assets/abarenbou.png" #:small "assets/abarenbou-225x300.png"]{}
I worked with ◊a[#:href
"http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/~jacky/"]{Dr. Jacky Baltes} to build a
small-size humanoid robot. I coded in C and cross compiled for the ARM
processor on a Sony Clie. I programmed it to walk and to find and kick
a ball. This was our entry in the 2005 FIRA RoboWorld Cup.

◊h4{Robot Airplane}
◊thumbnail[#:big "assets/airplane.png"]{}
At the University of Manitoba, I was part of a team that built a robot
airplane that could take-off, fly a search pattern, and land---all
autonomously. The airplane sent a video feed and telemetry to a ground
station, where one of our teammates could mark targets of interest and
report their coordinates. We placed first out of seventeen teams in a
competition that included BYU, University of Texas, Cornell, MIT, and
UCSD. I wrote much of the computer vision code, which transformed the
video feed's pixel coordinates into GPS coordinates, and presented
that information to our ground station's operator.

◊h4{AtmosView: Visualization Redesign}
◊thumbnail[#:big "assets/Screen-shot-2011-08-07-at-9.22.51-AM.png"]
I created AtmosView, a new visualization for atmospheric sounding data
(vertical profiles of the atmosphere's temperature and
humidity). People use this data to predict soaring conditions,
atmospheric stability, and the likelihood of severe weather. Previous
diagrams have been called the most difficult atmospheric diagrams to
read. AtmosView helps readers see this information on individual
charts, and allows them to more easily compare between multiple
charts.
