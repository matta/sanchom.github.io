I'm in my first year at UBC's Allard School of Law (class of 2021). I
want use law to help give the weakest of us a voice, in the justice
system and in society in general. This includes civil liberties,
especially free expression and defendants' rights. I want to help with
public legal education and access-to-justice initiatives, to give more
of us more confidence in the outcomes of the justice system and other
government decision-making processes. I'm also interested in copyright
law.

I'm trained as a computer scientist. In that field, I've focused on
visual object recognition, machine learning, and applications of deep
neural networks.

Formerly: data scientist at Kobo, head of R&D at Shelfie,
communications-and-development volunteer at the ◊a[#:href

Forces officer (Cadet Instructor Cadre), 2× Google intern.
