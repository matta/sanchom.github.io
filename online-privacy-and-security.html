The web­sites you’re con­nect­ing to would no longer see your IP ad­dress (they’d see an IP ad­dress of the VPN provider in­stead). VPN con­nec­tions also en­crypt traffic be­tween your de­vice and the VPN, even non-HTTPS traffic. Your ISP would no longer be able to see any of the traffic be­tween you and the in­ter­net.</p><p>When you use a VPN, you’re mov­ing some of the trust that you would nor­mal­ly place in your in­ter­net ser­vice provider (ISP) to your VPN provider. Your ISP would no longer see and po­ten­tial­ly log your traffic, but your VPN provider might. So, choose a VPN provider care­ful­ly, pay­ing at­ten­tion to their log­ging pol­i­cy and laws in the coun­try where they are based.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-10" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-10-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-10-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none"><span class="bibliography-entry full-form-citation" data-citation-id="�z�j�{�����������" data-citation-pinpoint="false" data-citation-parenthetical="false" data-citation-judge="false" data-citation-speaker="false" data-citation-signal="false">“<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/choosing-vpn-thats-right-you">Choosing the VPN That’s Right For You</a>”, <em>Electronic Frontier Foundation</em> (9 June 2016)<span data-short-form-placeholder="�z�j�{�����������"></span>.</span></label></span></span></p><p>Some cau­tion though: it is ac­tu­al­ly tricky to set up a VPN to ab­solute­ly route all traffic through the VPN. There are ways that you could in­ad­ver­tent­ly side-step your own VPN con­nec­tion. For ex­am­ple, if your VPN isn’t al­ways-on, any back­up ser­vices that run in the back­ground will send traffic over your non-VPN con­nec­tion any time that your VPN is dis­con­nect­ed. If those ser­vices hap­pen to start up be­fore your VPN starts up, you’ll be re­veal­ing your true IP ad­dress to Google Drive, or OneDrive, or DropBox, etc.</p><p>Further, if you have oth­er de­vices in your home that con­nect to ac­counts that you nor­mal­ly use via the VPN, the com­pa­ny run­ning the ac­count could link that in­for­ma­tion to­geth­er. If you con­nect to your Google ac­count on your phone and com­put­er through a VPN, but your Chromecast or smart speak­ers con­nect to your Google ac­count not through the VPN, Google would eas­i­ly be able to de­ter­mine that your VPN traffic should be at­trib­uted to the IP ad­dress as­so­ci­at­ed with your Chromecast or smart speak­ers. The con­clu­sion: to tru­ly pro­tect your IP ad­dress from Google or Amazon, etc. you’d have to ei­ther com­mit to not us­ing smart de­vices out­side of the VPN, or set up the VPN con­nec­tion di­rect­ly on your router, so that all traffic in your home is forced through the VPN.</p><p>There are oth­er ways that a VPN might pro­vide a false sense of se­cu­ri­ty: it might leak DNS queries to your ISP,<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-11" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-11-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-11-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none"><span class="bibliography-entry full-form-citation" data-citation-id="go�P�ش:vMYF#U�-w@�" data-citation-pinpoint="false" data-citation-parenthetical="false" data-citation-judge="false" data-citation-speaker="false" data-citation-signal="false">Dann Albright, “<a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/dns-leaks-can-destroy-anonymity-using-vpn-stop/">How DNS Leaks Can Destroy Anonymity When Using a VPN, And How to Stop Them</a>”, <em>MakeUseOf</em> (14 May 2015)<span data-short-form-placeholder="go�P�ش:vMYF#U�-w@�"></span>.</span></label></span></span> it might leak IPV6 con­nec­tions to your ISP.</p><h3 hyphens="none">Domain Name Servers</h3><p>The weak­est link in all of the above may be the ser­vice that con­verts a web­site name that you’ve re­quest­ed into an IP ad­dress.

This is one way that your ISP will be able to know what web­sites you’re vis­it­ing. But, there are ways to avoid leak­ing this in­for­ma­tion to your ISP. You can choose a VPN provider that han­dles DNS queries. Or, at least on the most re­cent ver­sions of Firefox, you can ask for your DNS queries to get sort­ed out over HTTPS (they’ll be en­crypt­ed, and sent to a more trust­ed DNS ser­vice).<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-12" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-12" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-12-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-12-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none"><span class="bibliography-entry full-form-citation" data-citation-id="�ho��m��jr����Cd��" data-citation-pinpoint="false" data-citation-parenthetical="false" data-citation-judge="false" data-citation-speaker="false" data-citation-signal="false">Nykolas Z, “<a href="https://medium.com/@nykolas.z/dns-security-and-privacy-choosing-the-right-provider-61fc6d54b986">DNS Security and Privacy — Choosing the right provider</a>”, <em>medi­um.com</em> (18 April 2018)<span data-short-form-placeholder="�ho��m��jr����Cd��"></span>.</span></label></span></span></p><figure><p><img potential-feature="potential-feature" src="assets/dns-over-https.png"/></p><figcaption>The lat­est ver­sion of Firefox al­lows for DNS over HTTPS.
