    <root><h1>Canadian Aviation Regulations</h1><h2>About this book</h2><p>This book will help pre­pare you for Canada’s Private Pilot writ­ten exam (aero­plane). It will not present all the ma­te­r­i­al you need to know; it will present a lot of it, but more­so, it will teach you how to un­der­stand the ref­er­ences that you your­self can use to pre­pare for the exam.</p><p>Your in­struc­tor can do lit­tle more than set you up to be able to study well. You lit­er­al­ly just need to mem­o­rize the ma­te­r­i­al. To help you with that mem­o­riza­tion, this book will help you un­der­stand the struc­ture of the reg­u­la­tions, re­late reg­u­la­tions to specific sce­nar­ios, and give you effective study tech­niques for mem­o­riza­tion.</p><p>The reg­u­la­tions and top­ics that you’re ex­pect­ed to know are list­ed in <a href="https://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/publications/tp12880-air_law-menu-1226.htm">Transport Canada’s Study and Reference Guide</a>. Everything you’ll need to work through this book is avail­able on­line. You’ll find links to re­lat­ed ma­te­r­i­al through­out the book. A full list of ref­er­ences are avail­able in the ap­pen­dix, but 99% of the ma­te­r­i­al comes straight from the <em>Canadian Aviation Regulations</em> and the <em>Aeronautical Information Manual</em>.</p><h2>How to study the Canadian Aviation Regulations</h2><p>One way to study for this sec­tion of the writ­ten exam is to just look at each sec­tion list­ed in the Study and Reference Guide and mem­o­rize it. In the end, that’s what all prepa­ra­tion meth­ods get you to do, but if some­how you have an ex­cep­tion­al mem­o­ry or your own meth­ods that get you there, it real­ly could be that sim­ple. But, that’s a bit like say­ing, “just be smart.”</p><p>When I was study­ing for the Commercial Pilot writ­ten ex­am­i­na­tion, I copy-and-past­ed every rel­e­vant sec­tion from the CARs into a doc­u­ment and print­ed it out. With small text and small mar­gins it took about fifty dou­ble-sided pages. Through this ex­er­cise of brows­ing the CARs, copy-and-past­ing, and then read­ing through them on my own again, I mem­o­rized a lot of the ma­te­r­i­al. It might be use­ful for you to do some­thing like that, but if you want to skip to the end re­sult, here’s a re­cent­ly-com­piled set of CARs that are ref­er­enced by the Study and Reference Guide.</p><p><em>Spaced rep­ti­tion</em> is a method of study that is es­pe­cial­ly use­ful for large-scale mem­o­riza­tion tasks. There are many free soft­ware pro­grams that you can use to help you with this. I’ve used Anki. (Not for study­ing the CARs though; I learned about Anki long af­ter I had finished my li­cences.) I’ve pre­pared a deck of CARs cards that you can im­port into Anki, but I think it would be more use­ful for you to do this your­self. Every chance to look at the ma­te­r­i­al from a different per­spec­tive is a chance to bet­ter learn the ma­te­r­i­al.</p><p>This book will also give you those chances.</p><h2>Structure of the Canadian Aviation Regulations</h2><h3>Parts</h3><p>The CARs are or­ga­nized into eight parts, but only five are rel­e­vant for your pri­vate pi­lot writ­ten ex­am­i­na­tion:</p><ul><li>Part I (General Provisions): definitions, most­ly.</li><li>Part II (Aircraft Identification and Registration): certificate of reg­is­tra­tion.</li><li>Part III (Aerodromes and Airports): Lighting, mark­ings.</li><li>Part IV (Personnel Licensing and Training): Prerequisites, med­ical re­quire­ments, re­cen­cy.</li><li>Part VI (General Operating and Flight Rules): Airspace, al­ti­tude min­i­ma, col­li­sion avoid­ance, equip­ment re­quire­ments, VFR pro­ce­dures, etc.</li></ul><h3>Subparts and di­vi­sions</h3><p>Each part is fur­ther bro­ken down into sub­parts and di­vi­sions, but I nev­er found those dis­tinc­tions use­ful for help­ing me un­der­stand the ma­te­r­i­al for the Private Pilot li­cence. <span><label for="3818525571" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="3818525571" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="margin-note">Subparts <em>are</em> an use­ful dis­tinc­tion in Part VII, where Subpart 2 (702.xxx) is about aer­i­al work, Subpart 3 (703.xxx) is about air taxi op­er­a­tions, Subpart 4 (704.xxx) is about com­muter op­er­a­tions, and Subpart 5 (705.xxx) is about air­line op­er­a­tions.</span></span></p><h3>Sections</h3><p>The ba­sic unit of reg­u­la­tion is a <em>Section</em>. For ex­am­ple, this is sec­tion 602.01:</p><blockquote><div><p><b>602.01</b> <Text>No per­son shall op­er­ate an air­craft in such a reck­less or neg­li­gent man­ner as to en­dan­ger or be like­ly to en­dan­ger the life or prop­er­ty of any per­son.</Text></p></div></blockquote><p>The num­ber, 602.01, in­di­cates that this is the first sec­tion in Subpart 2 of Part VI of the CARs.</p><h3>Definitions</h3><p>602.01 refers to “air­craft”. What things are con­sid­ered “air­craft”? You can prob­a­bly guess that Cessnas are air­craft. But what about glid­ers, bal­loons, rock­ets, drones? Are these all air­craft too?</p><p>Whenever you are look­ing for a definition, search “in­side-out”. Start at the sec­tion it­self and see if the term is defined there. If it is, great. If not, move on to the en­clos­ing Division, then Subpart, then Part, and then 101.01 (the CARs-wide definitions).</p><p>Let’s con­tin­ue with this ex­am­ple and search for the definition of air­craft. The sec­tion it­self doesn’t define “air­craft”.</p><p>So, let’s move to the en­clos­ing di­vi­sion (Part VI, Subpart 2, Division 1). There are no definitions there.</p><p>Next, on to the en­clos­ing <em>sub­part</em> (Part VI, Subpart 2). There are also no definitions there.</p><p>When we look to the en­clos­ing <em>part</em> (Part VI), we finally find some definitions:</p><blockquote><p><b>600.01</b> In this Part,</p><p><b><em>ADIZ</em></b> or <b><em>Air Defence Identification Zone</em></b> means the air­space that ex­tends up­ward from the sur­face in those ar­eas of Canada and off the coasts of Canada, the bound­aries of which are specified in the <em>Designated Airspace Handbook</em>;</p><p>[…]</p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, “air­craft” isn’t defined there. There’s one last place in the CARs where “air­craft” might be defined: the catch-all 101.01.</p><blockquote><p><b>101.01 (1)</b> In these Regulations,</p><p><b><em>ACAS</em></b> or <b><em>Airborne Collision Avoidance System</em></b> means […];</p><p><b><em>Act</em></b> means […];</p><p><b><em>ad­vanced ul­tra-light aero­plane</em></b> means […];</p><p>[…]</p><p><b><em>aero­plane</em></b> means a pow­er-dri­ven heav­ier-than-air air­craft that de­rives its lift in flight from aero­dy­nam­ic re­ac­tions on sur­faces that re­main fixed dur­ing flight;</p><p>[…]</p></blockquote><p>It looks like the CARs defines “aero­plane”, but not “air­craft”. Transport Canada uses the term “air­craft” through­out the CARs, but doesn’t ac­tu­al­ly define it. This can’t be right.</p><p>I’ve mis­led you. There is one more place where a definition might be found: the <em>Aeronautics Act</em>. <span><label for="931730241" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="931730241" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="margin-note"><em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-2/FullText.html">Aeronautics Act</a></em>. R.S.C., 1985, c.&nbsp;A&#8209;2</span></span> It’s what gives Transport Canada the au­thor­i­ty to cre­ate the CARs and it also has a few definitions. In the <em>Aeronautics Act</em>, we learn what an air­craft is:</p><blockquote><b><em>air­craft</em></b> means […] any ma­chine ca­pa­ble of de­riv­ing sup­port in the at­mos­phere from re­ac­tions of the air, and in­cludes a rock­et;</blockquote><p>It turns out “air­craft” is a very broad con­cept. Gliders are air­craft. Drones are air­craft. Rockets are air­craft.</p><h2>Case Study 1</h2><h2>Enforcement Actions</h2><h2>Regulations vs. Standards</h2><h2>Airport Procedures</h2><h2>Table-top Scenarios</h2></root>
