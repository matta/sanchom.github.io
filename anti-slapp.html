The old ver­sion would have had the Act ap­ply to pro­ceed­ings com­menced “at any time be­fore or af­ter this Act comes into force.” So, the new ver­sion is now more like Ontario’s which ap­plies to pro­ceed­ings “com­menced on or af­ter the day the Protection of Public Participation Act, 2015 re­ceived first read­ing.”</p><h2 hyphens="none">Highlights and comparisons with other models</h2><p>There are very few differences be­tween the BC Act, the Uniform Law Conference of Canada’s <a href="https://www.ulcc.ca/images/stories/2016_pdf_en/2016ulcc0031.pdf"><em>Uniform Protection of Public Participation Act</em></a><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-6" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-6-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-6-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none">Uniform Law Conference of Canada, <a href="https://www.ulcc.ca/images/stories/2016_pdf_en/2016ulcc0031.pdf"><em>Uniform Protection of Public Participation Act</em></a>, 2017.</label></span></span>, and Ontario’s Act. This is be­cause the <em>BC PPPA</em> is based on the Uniform Act which is in turn based on the Ontario Act.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-7" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-7-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-7-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none"><span class="bibliography-entry full-form-citation" data-citation-id="1st reading" data-citation-pinpoint="4742" data-citation-parenthetical="false" data-citation-judge="false" data-citation-speaker="false" data-citation-signal="false">“Bill C-32, Protection of Public Participation Act”, 1st read­ing, <a href="https://www.leg.bc.ca/content/hansard/41st3rd/20180515am-Hansard-n137.pdf">British Columbia, <em>Official Report of Debates (Hansard)</em>, 41-3, No 137</a> (15 May 2018) at 4742<span data-short-form-placeholder="1st reading"></span>.</span> Or, <a href="https://videoarchive.leg.bc.ca/Harmony/en/PowerBrowser/PowerBrowserV2?viewmode=3&amp;fk=201805151000-house&amp;startposition=957">watch the video</a>!</label></span></span></p><p>The core pro­vi­sion of each of these acts is es­sen­tial­ly iden­ti­cal.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-8" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-8-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-8-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none"><span class="bibliography-entry" data-citation-id="BC PPPA"><span>BC <em>PPPA</em></span>, <em>supra</em> note 3, cl 4(2)(b).</span></label></span></span> It re­quires the anti-SLAPP ap­pli­cant (the de­fen­dant) to es­tab­lish first that the pro­ceed­ings re­late to ex­pres­sion made by the ap­pli­cant that re­lates to a mat­ter of pub­lic in­ter­est. If the ap­pli­cant shows this, then the bur­den shifts to the anti-SLAPP re­spon­dent (the plaintiff) to con­vince the judge that the case has sufficient mer­it and that the pub­lic in­ter­est weighs in favour of al­low­ing the pro­ceed­ings to con­tin­ue.</p><p>Another es­sen­tial piece is how costs are han­dled. If the anti-SLAPP ap­pli­cant suc­cess­ful­ly gets the lit­i­ga­tion dis­missed, they are en­ti­tled, as a start­ing point, to full costs in the anti-SLAPP mo­tion and in the un­der­ly­ing pro­ceed­ing. And if the court finds that the plaintiff brought the orig­i­nal pro­ceed­ing on bad faith, they can award dam­ages to the anti-SLAPP ap­pli­cant. On the oth­er hand, if the anti-SLAPP mo­tion is not suc­cess­ful, and the pro­ceed­ing is not dis­missed, the anti-SLAPP re­spon­dent (the plaintiff) is not en­ti­tled to costs. This is a very de­fen­dant-friend­ly costs regime.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-9" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-9-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-9-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none"><span class="bibliography-entry" data-citation-id="BC PPPA"><em>Ibid</em>, cls 7–8.</span></label></span></span></p><p>BC and Ontario both differ from the Uniform Act re­gard­ing what pro­ceed­ings they will ap­ply to. The Uniform Act rec­om­mends that the Act ap­ply to any pro­ceed­ings when­ev­er they were com­menced. BC’s and Ontario’s both only ap­ply to pro­ceed­ings com­menced af­ter a cer­tain date.</p><p>The <em>BC PPPA</em> re­quires that “on an ap­pli­ca­tion for a dis­missal or­der un­der sec­tion 4, ev­i­dence must be giv­en by affidavit.” Neither the Uniform Act nor Ontario’s Act have this re­stric­tion, al­though they seem to con­tem­plate it, by pro­vid­ing lim­i­ta­tions on the time that par­ties can spend cross-ex­am­in­ing on doc­u­men­tary ev­i­dence.</p><p>The Uniform Act and Ontario’s Act re­quire that the anti-SLAPP mo­tion be heard with­in 60 days of filing. The <em>BC PPPA</em> re­quires that the anti-SLAPP mo­tion be heard as soon as prac­ti­ca­ble.</p><p>An in­ter­est­ing piece is how anti-SLAPP mo­tions in­ter­act with ad­min­is­tra­tive or tri­bunal pro­ceed­ings. Once a de­fen­dant has filed an anti-SLAPP mo­tion, they can use that no­tice of ap­pli­ca­tion to put the ad­min­is­tra­tive pro­ceed­ing on hold.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-10" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-10-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-10-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none"><span class="bibliography-entry" data-citation-id="BC PPPA"><em>Ibid</em>, cl 11.</span></label></span></span> The Uniform Law Conference ex­plains:</p><blockquote> This pro­vi­sion aims to give a prospec­tive plaintiff rea­son to think care­ful­ly be­fore launch­ing a law­suit against its crit­ics. Often such a par­ty has some oth­er official pro­ceed­ing go­ing on, such as an ap­pli­ca­tion for re­zon­ing or a build­ing per­mit. If that pro­ceed­ing will be stayed pend­ing the de­ter­mi­na­tion of a mo­tion to dis­miss un­der the present statute, that po­ten­tial de­lay may be more im­por­tant to the plaintiff than get­ting a rem­e­dy for the de­fen­dant’s ex­pres­sion.  </blockquote><p>There is also some­thing spe­cial about Canadian anti-SLAPP leg­is­la­tion com­pared to US anti-SLAPP leg­is­la­tion. Canadian leg­is­la­tion tells the court to ask whether “the harm like­ly to have been or to be suffered by the re­spon­dent as a re­sult of the ap­pli­cant’s ex­pres­sion is se­ri­ous enough that the pub­lic in­ter­est in con­tin­u­ing the pro­ceed­ing out­weighs the pub­lic in­ter­est in pro­tect­ing that ex­pres­sion.”<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-11" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-11-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-11-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none"><span class="bibliography-entry" data-citation-id="BC PPPA"><em>Ibid</em>, cl 4(2)(b).</span></label></span></span> In or­der to pro­ceed af­ter the de­fen­dant has proven their side of an anti-SLAPP mo­tion, the plaintiff has to con­vince the court (among oth­er things) that the ex­pres­sion at is­sue is caus­ing them se­ri­ous enough harm to war­rant putting that ex­pres­sion to the test of a full-fledged defama­tion lit­i­ga­tion.</p><p>This kind of bal­anc­ing is not found in the Institute for Justice’s <a href="https://ij.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/anti-slapp-model.pdf">Model Anti-SLAPP Legislation</a> (see sec­tion 100.6 (1)).</p><h2 hyphens="none">What does it mean?</h2><p>Again, the <a href="https://www.leg.bc.ca/content/data%20-%20ldp/Pages/41st4th/1st_read/gov02-1.htm"><em>BC PPPA</em></a> is real­ly short, so do read it, but the main pro­vi­sion is clause 4:</p><blockquote class="code"><pre class="code">

It ex­plains the gen­e­sis of the harm-bal­anc­ing pro­vi­sion (4(2)(b), in BC). Ontario’s Anti-SLAPP Advisory Panel ob­served in its re­port:</p><blockquote>If an ac­tion against ex­pres­sion on a mat­ter of pub­lic in­ter­est is based on a tech­ni­cal­ly valid cause of ac­tion but seeks a rem­e­dy for only insignificant harm to rep­u­ta­tion, busi­ness or per­son­al in­ter­ests, the ac­tion’s neg­a­tive im­pact on free­dom of ex­pres­sion may be clear­ly dis­pro­por­tion­ate to any valid pur­pose the lit­i­ga­tion might serve.</blockquote><p>The de­ci­sion also quotes from the Ontario’s Attorney General dur­ing the leg­isla­tive de­bates:</p><blockquote>I strong­ly be­lieve that the law must de­fend rep­u­ta­tion, but not at any cost and not in every case. I do not be­lieve that a mere tech­ni­cal case—with­out ac­tu­al harm—should be al­lowed to sup­press the kind of de­mo­c­ra­t­ic ex­pres­sion that is cru­cial for our de­moc­ra­cy.</blockquote><p>This seems to be the crux of an anti-SLAPP mo­tion and I think most of the work will be done at this bal­anc­ing stage.</p><p>The court also dis­tin­guish­es the Ontario Act from now-re­pealed British Columbia anti-SLAPP leg­is­la­tion from 2001. That 2001 act fo­cused on the plaintiff’s mo­tive or pur­pose as a de­ter­mi­na­tive fac­tor. Modern anti-SLAPP leg­is­la­tion based on Ontario’s mod­el “in­stead as­sess­es the po­ten­tial mer­its of the claim and the effects of per­mit­ting the claim to pro­ceed on com­pet­ing com­po­nents of the pub­lic in­ter­est.”</p><p>The court goes on to split up the anti-SLAPP analy­sis into stages, based on the text of the core pro­vi­sion.</p><h3 hyphens="none">1. The threshold requirement</h3><p>First, the de­fen­dant (the anti-SLAPP ap­pli­cant) needs to es­tab­lish on the bal­ance of prob­a­bil­i­ties that (a) the pro­ceed­ings arise from ex­pres­sion made by the de­fen­dant, and (b) the ex­pres­sion re­lates to a mat­ter of pub­lic in­ter­est.</p><p>“Expression” is defined very broad­ly in the act: “any com­mu­ni­ca­tion, whether it is made ver­bal­ly or non-ver­bal­ly, pub­licly or pri­vate­ly, and whether it is di­rect­ed or not di­rect­ed at a per­son or en­ti­ty.”</p><p>The trick­i­er part is de­ter­min­ing whether an ex­pres­sion re­lates to a mat­ter of pub­lic in­ter­est.</p><p>Here, the court says that the prin­ci­ples from <em>Grant v Torstar Corp</em><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-13" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-13" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-13-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-13-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none"><span class="bibliography-entry full-form-citation" data-citation-id="��r���I�OjW�r�2G(" data-citation-pinpoint="false" data-citation-parenthetical="false" data-citation-judge="false" data-citation-speaker="false" data-citation-signal="false"><em><a href="https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/7837/index.do">Grant v Torstar Corp</a></em>, 2009 SCC 61<span data-short-form-placeholder="��r���I�OjW�r�2G("></span>.</span></label></span></span> are ap­plic­a­ble. The ques­tion is to be an­swered ob­jec­tive­ly, in con­text, and in the en­tire­ty of the com­mu­ni­ca­tion. An ex­pres­sion might have more than one mat­ter. If one of those mat­ters is a “mat­ter of pub­lic in­ter­est”, that is enough. It is enough that “some seg­ment of the com­mu­ni­ty has a gen­uine in­ter­est” in the mat­ter of the ex­pres­sion. But, that must be more than cu­rios­i­ty or pruri­ent in­ter­est. This also isn’t about as­sess­ing the im­pact on the is­sue to which it is di­rect­ed. The judge is not to ask whether the ex­pres­sion has a beneficial im­pact on the is­sue.</p><p>The de­fen­dant (the anti-SLAPP ap­pli­cant) needs to show all of that: that the pro­ceed­ings arise from their ex­pres­sion re­lat­ing to a mat­ter of pub­lic in­ter­est.

  (a) there are grounds to be­lieve that

    (i) the pro­ceed­ing has sub­stan­tial mer­it, and

    (ii) the ap­pli­cant has no valid de­fence in the pro­ceed­ing, and</pre></blockquote><p>The stan­dard here is also a bal­ance of prob­a­bil­i­ties. The judge needs to be satisfied that there are rea­son­able grounds to be­lieve that there is sub­stan­tial mer­it to the claim and that the de­fen­dant has no valid de­fence. The court em­pha­sizes that this is just ju­di­cial screen­ing, not a sum­ma­ry judge­ment. The very lim­it­ed pro­ce­dure al­lowed dur­ing an anti-SLAPP mo­tion doesn’t al­low ei­ther side to put their “best foot for­ward”. The judge is not to do a deep dive into the cred­i­bil­i­ty of the affiants or mer­its. The ques­tion is just whether “whether, on the en­tire­ty of the ma­te­r­i­al, there are rea­son­able grounds to be­lieve that a rea­son­able tri­er could ac­cept the ev­i­dence.”</p><p>With re­spect to the “no valid de­fence” ques­tion, the plaintiff only needs to ad­dress the de­fences ad­vanced by the de­fen­dant in their plead­ings or in their anti-SLAPP mo­tion. The judge needs to be con­vinced that a tri­er of fact could con­clude that none of the de­fences would suc­ceed. If that is con­clu­sion is rea­son­ably avail­able, the plaintiff has met the onus.</p><h3 hyphens="none">2b. The harm-balancing hurdle</h3><p>Even if the plaintiff meets the mer­its-based hur­dle above, they also need to show that:</p><blockquote class="code"><pre class="code">the harm like­ly to have been or to be suffered by the re­spon­dent as a
re­sult of the ap­pli­cant's ex­pres­sion is se­ri­ous enough that the pub­lic
in­ter­est in con­tin­u­ing the pro­ceed­ing out­weighs the pub­lic in­ter­est in
pro­tect­ing that ex­pres­sion.
</pre></blockquote><p>This means that some claims will be ter­mi­nat­ed here, even though they could suc­ceed on their mer­its at tri­al.</p><p>I think this is where most cas­es will be de­cid­ed. Given the low ev­i­den­tiary stan­dard for the oth­er steps, I can imag­ine most par­ties meet­ing their bur­dens there, forc­ing the judge to grap­ple with this bal­anc­ing de­ci­sion.</p><blockquote>The plaintiff must sat­is­fy the mo­tion judge that the harm caused to it by the de­fen­dant’s ex­pres­sion is “sufficiently se­ri­ous” that the pub­lic in­ter­est en­gaged in al­low­ing the plaintiff to pro­ceed with the claim out­weighs the pub­lic in­ter­est in pro­tect­ing the de­fen­dant’s free­dom of ex­pres­sion.</blockquote><p>The harm can be in the form of mon­e­tary dam­ages, but non-mon­e­tary harm also counts: rep­u­ta­tion, pri­va­cy, and harm to in­her­ent lib­er­ty and se­cu­ri­ty in­ter­ests.</p><p>On an anti-SLAPP mo­tion, the judge needs only enough ma­te­r­i­al to be able to work out an es­ti­mate of quan­ti­ta­tive dam­ages. This doesn’t need to be ful­ly de­vel­oped ev­i­dence. The judge is to make a com­mon sense read­ing and only needs to see that the chal­lenged ex­pres­sion is causal­ly con­nect­ed to harm that is more than nom­i­nal. The plaintiff can’t just rely on bald as­ser­tions.</p><p>That harm needs to be weighed against the pub­lic in­ter­est in pro­tect­ing the ex­pres­sion at is­sue.</p><p>The term “pub­lic in­ter­est” in this clause here takes on a different mean­ing than in a “mat­ter of pub­lic in­ter­est” in the thresh­old stage (which re­ferred to the con­tent of the ex­pres­sion). Here, the term “pub­lic in­ter­est” means some­thing more like “pub­lic benefit”. At this stage, it is rec­og­nized that some forms of speech are less de­serv­ing of a shield against full lit­i­ga­tion: “de­lib­er­ate false­hoods, gra­tu­itous per­son­al at­tacks, vul­gar or offensive lan­guage” might at­tract less pro­tec­tion from lit­i­ga­tion than “the same mes­sage with­out the lies, vit­ri­ol, and ob­scen­i­ties.” The court also con­sid­ers ev­i­dence of ac­tu­al li­bel chill in this part of the bal­anc­ing: if al­low­ing the lit­i­ga­tion to pro­ceed would dis­cour­age oth­er sim­i­lar­ly-sit­u­at­ed speak­ers, that might weigh in favour of dis­miss­ing the case.</p><p>If the pub­lic in­ter­est in al­low­ing the lit­i­ga­tion to pro­ceed (tak­ing into ac­count the harm to the plaintiff) out­weighs the pub­lic in­ter­est in pro­tect­ing the ex­pres­sion at is­sue, then, as long as the plaintiff has also met the mer­its-based hur­dle, the anti-SLAPP mo­tion will be dis­missed and the lit­i­ga­tion can con­tin­ue.</p><p>This is all a qual­i­ta­tive bal­ance. The judge needs to give full rea­sons for their eval­u­a­tions in this step and ap­peals courts must de­fer to those bal­anc­ing de­ci­sions.</p><h2 hyphens="none">Charter challenges</h2><p>The Ontario Court of Appeal also dis­missed two <em>Charter</em> chal­lenges to the Ontario Act in <a href="http://www.ontariocourts.ca/decisions/2018/2018ONCA0687.pdf"><em>Platnick v Bent</em></a>.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-14" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-14" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-14-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-14-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none"><span class="bibliography-entry full-form-citation" data-citation-id="�9b{=�~���!�� ��\" data-citation-pinpoint="false" data-citation-parenthetical="false" data-citation-judge="false" data-citation-speaker="false" data-citation-signal="false"><em><a href="http://www.ontariocourts.ca/decisions/2018/2018ONCA0687.pdf">Platnick v Bent</a></em>, 2018 ONCA 687<span data-short-form-placeholder="�9b{=�~���!�� ��\"></span>.</span></label></span></span></p><p>Platnick ar­gued that the Act is an un­con­sti­tu­tion­al in­fringe­ment on one’s lib­er­ty be­cause it lim­its, in a man­ner in­con­sis­tent with prin­ci­ples of fun­da­men­tal jus­tice, one’s abil­i­ty to de­fend one’s rep­u­ta­tion.

That analagous group: “those pro­tect­ing con­sti­tu­tion­al prin­ci­ples and val­ues of su­per­or­di­nate im­por­tance.” This claim was re­ject­ed be­cause to ac­cept such a broad de­scrip­tion of an analagous group would be pro­vide a path to chal­lenge al­most any leg­isla­tive dis­tinc­tion.
