<h1>What is Inception-v2?</h1>

  <p>Inception-v4, Inception-ResNet and the Impact of Residual Connections on Learning says:</p>

<p>"Later the Inception architecture was refined in various ways, first by the introduction of batch normalization
  (Inception-v2) by Ioffe et al." (citing Ioffe and Szegedy's Batch Normalization Paper).</p>

  <p>That paper describes its network like this:</p>

<p>"The main difference to [Inception-v1] is that the 5 × 5
convolutional layers are replaced by two consecutive layers
  of 3 × 3 convolutions with up to 128 filters."</p>

<p>Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision has a section (Section 6) titled "Inception-v2". It 
describes a network with many more changes than the Batch Normalization paper listed compared to Inception-v1. It
also includes a table that has separate entries for "BN-GoogLeNet", "BN-Inception", and "Inception-v2". (This introduces an
  new question: Is GoogLeNet different than Inception?)</p>
