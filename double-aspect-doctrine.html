On April 26, 2018, the BC gov­ern­ment asked the BC Court of Appeal to de­cide (among oth­er things) whether the province has the pow­er to make cer­tain amend­ments to the to the Environmental Management Act that would affect a pro­posed pipeline be­ing built by the fed­er­al gov­ern­ment. See the <a href="https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018PREM0019-000742">news re­lease</a>. Update: The BC Court of Appeal re­ject­ed the province’s char­ac­ter­i­za­tion that is reflected in this di­a­gram.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><a href="#fn-1" class="undecorated"><span class="sidenote-number" id="fn-source-1"></span></a></span></figcaption></figure><p>Federalism is a broad sub­cat­e­go­ry with­in Canadian con­sti­tu­tion­al law. In this con­text, fed­er­al­ism refers to the di­vi­sion of law-mak­ing pow­er be­tween our provin­cial and fed­er­al gov­ern­ments.</p><blockquote>In a fed­er­al sys­tem of gov­ern­ment such as ours, po­lit­i­cal pow­er is shared by two or­ders of gov­ern­ment: the fed­er­al gov­ern­ment on the one hand, and the provinces on the oth­er. Each is as­signed re­spec­tive spheres of ju­ris­dic­tion by the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em>. The fed­er­al struc­ture of our coun­try also fa­cil­i­tates de­mo­c­ra­t­ic par­tic­i­pa­tion by dis­trib­ut­ing pow­er to the gov­ern­ment thought to be most suit­ed to achiev­ing the par­tic­u­lar so­ci­etal ob­jec­tive hav­ing re­gard to this di­ver­si­ty.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><a href="#fn-2" class="undecorated"><span class="sidenote-number" id="fn-source-2"></span></a></span></blockquote><p>But, this di­vi­sion of pow­er is not wa­ter­tight. “The his­to­ry of Canadian con­sti­tu­tion­al law has been to al­low for a fair amount of in­ter­play and in­deed over­lap be­tween fed­er­al and provin­cial pow­ers.”<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><a href="#fn-3" class="undecorated"><span class="sidenote-number" id="fn-source-3"></span></a></span> One way that this over­lap plays out is through the dou­ble-as­pect doc­trine.</p><p><em>Multiple Access Ltd v McCutcheon</em><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><a href="#fn-4" class="undecorated"><span class="sidenote-number" id="fn-source-4"></span></a></span>, the case gen­er­al­ly used to in­tro­duce the dou­ble-as­pect doc­trine, conflates two kinds of dou­ble­ness and this can lead to an over­ly nar­row con­cep­tion of the doc­trine. This ar­ti­cle presents how I’ve come to think of the dou­ble-as­pect doc­trine and one way of teas­ing apart the ways in which the doc­trine is used.</p><p><em>Multiple Access</em> con­cerned leg­is­la­tion en­act­ed by the fed­er­al and Ontario gov­ern­ments with pro­vi­sions that over­lapped significantly both in their ex­pres­sion and in the peo­ple and con­duct cov­ered. Look at sec­tion 100.4 of the <em>Canada Corporations Act</em><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><a href="#fn-5" class="undecorated"><span class="sidenote-number" id="fn-source-5"></span></a></span> and sec­tion 113 of Ontario’s <em>Securities Act</em><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><a href="#fn-6" class="undecorated"><span class="sidenote-number" id="fn-source-6"></span></a></span> to see how sim­i­lar the pro­vi­sions were: they pro­hib­it­ed the ex­act same ac­tiv­i­ties.</p><p>Multiple Access Ltd was a fed­er­al­ly in­cor­po­rat­ed com­pa­ny, so was with­in scope of the <em>Canada Corporations Act</em>. It also had its pub­lic stock list­ed for trad­ing on the Toronto Stock Exchange, bring­ing it with­in the scope of Ontario’s <em>Securities Act</em>.</p><p>Multiple Access’s share­hold­ers got Ontario’s Securities Commission to com­mence in­sid­er-trad­ing en­force­ment against the com­pa­ny un­der the Ontario act. Those share­hold­ers could have equal­ly sought en­force­ment un­der the fed­er­al act, but the lim­i­ta­tions pe­ri­od un­der the fed­er­al act had ex­pired. This was the only ma­te­r­i­al difference be­tween the two acts as they ap­plied to this com­pa­ny.</p><p>Multiple Access asked the court to de­clare that the fed­er­al act (with the al­ready-ex­pired lim­i­ta­tions pe­ri­od) was valid and thus ren­der the provin­cial law in­valid. That sec­ond step (ren­der­ing the provin­cial law in­valid) would only fol­low if the va­lid­i­ty of a fed­er­al pro­vi­sion pre­cludes the va­lid­i­ty of a near­ly-iden­ti­cal provin­cial law giv­en the di­vi­sion of pow­ers set out in sec­tions 91 and 92 of the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em>. Multiple Access ar­gued that a par­tic­u­lar pro­vi­sion could only be valid as ei­ther fed­er­al or provin­cial leg­is­la­tion and that the court had to choose.</p><p>The court used the dou­ble-as­pect doc­trine to avoid this choice. It ex­plained the doc­trine us­ing ma­te­r­i­al from an ar­ti­cle by William Lederman, “Classification of Laws and the British North America Act.” Lederman’s ar­ti­cle and <em>Multiple Access</em> con­tem­plate one kind of sce­nario in which the dou­ble-as­pect doc­trine can arise (when the court is asked to choose which of the fed­er­al or provin­cial gov­ern­ments gets to pass a par­tic­u­lar law), but in this sce­nario, two kinds of dou­ble­ness are conflated.</p><p><em>Multiple Access</em> and Lederman’s ar­ti­cle talk about the dou­ble-as­pect doc­trine as if the fed­er­al and provin­cial gov­ern­ments are play­ing tug-of-war over one par­tic­u­lar law, ask­ing, “who gets to en­act it?” Double-as­pect en­ters when the an­swer is, “both of you.” This is the set­ting where we look for a 50/50 split be­tween the provin­cial and fed­er­al fea­tures of a law. If a law has a rough­ly 50/50 split be­tween its provin­cial and fed­er­al fea­tures, then the court will find both the provin­cial and fed­er­al pro­vi­sions valid. This is what hap­pened in <em>Multiple Access</em>.</p><blockquote><p>[…] some over­lap­ping in­evitably re­mains. Where this oc­curs, ei­ther one of two things has then been done. First, the na­ture of <u>the chal­lenged law</u> rel­e­vant to a provin­cial class of pow­ers has been com­plete­ly ig­nored as only an “in­ci­den­tal affectation” of the provin­cial sphere, and <u>the law</u> con­cerned has been classed only by that fea­ture of it rel­e­vant to a fed­er­al class of laws. Thus, in spite of the log­i­cal over­lap the de­ci­sion is made that only the fed­er­al Parliament has pow­er to en­act <u>the chal­lenged law</u>. Obviously this de­ci­sion in­volves a judge­ment that the provin­cial fea­ture of <u>the law</u> is quite unim­por­tant rel­a­tive to its fed­er­al fea­ture. On the oth­er hand if the fed­er­al fea­ture be deemed quite unim­por­tant rel­a­tive to the provin­cial fea­ture, then the con­verse de­ci­sion would be made. […]</p><p>But, if the con­trast be­tween the rel­a­tive im­por­tance of the two fea­tures is not so sharp […] the de­ci­sion is made that <u>the chal­lenged rule</u> could be en­act­ed by ei­ther the fed­er­al Parliament or a provin­cial leg­is­la­ture. [em­pha­sis added]</p></blockquote><p>However, the dou­ble-as­pect doc­trine is not so nar­row: it is used even when du­pli­ca­tion is not an is­sue. In 1883, the Privy Council char­ac­ter­ized it broad­ly: “sub­jects which in one as­pect and for one pur­pose fall with­in sec­tion 92, may in an­oth­er as­pect and for an­oth­er pur­pose fall with­in sec­tion 91.”<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><a href="#fn-7" class="undecorated"><span class="sidenote-number" id="fn-source-7"></span></a></span> Some notes in <em>Canadian Constitutional Law</em> try to ex­plain this, but it’s easy to miss.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><a href="#fn-8" class="undecorated"><span class="sidenote-number" id="fn-source-8"></span></a></span> In its broad­est con­cep­tion, the dou­ble-as­pect doc­trine ex­plains any sce­nario where the courts al­low leg­is­la­tion from our two lev­els of gov­ern­ment to touch a par­tic­u­lar field. The dou­ble-as­pect doc­trine is not re­served for cas­es where the two lev­els of gov­ern­ment play tug-of-war over a pro­vi­sion; it is also at play when they play tug-of-war over a field, through <em>different pro­vi­sions</em>, through <em>different</em> law.</p><p>“In most cas­es, ap­pli­ca­tion of the doc­trine sim­ply en­tails the court ev­i­denc­ing a will­ing­ness to ap­ply the pith and sub­stance doc­trine flexibly, and to char­ac­ter­ize sim­i­lar fed­er­al and provin­cial en­act­ments in such a man­ner as to per­mit the court to up­hold both en­act­ments as valid.”<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><a href="#fn-9" class="undecorated"><span class="sidenote-number" id="fn-source-9"></span></a></span></p><p>Here are some more re­cent state­ments that demon­strate the breadth of the doc­trine:</p><blockquote> Activities, acts or con­duct can some­times be viewed from different nor­ma­tive per­spec­tives, one re­lat­ing to a fed­er­al pow­er and the oth­er to a provin­cial pow­er. Where this is the case, the dou­ble as­pect doc­trine is en­gaged.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><a href="#fn-10" class="undecorated"><span class="sidenote-number" id="fn-source-10"></span></a></span></blockquote><blockquote> “Double oc­cu­pan­cy” of a field of en­deav­our, such as health, is a per­ma­nent fea­ture of the Canadian con­sti­tu­tion­al or­der. It leads to a stan­dard “dou­ble as­pect” analy­sis un­der which both as­pects sub­sist side by side.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><a href="#fn-11" class="undecorated"><span class="sidenote-number" id="fn-source-11"></span></a></span></blockquote><blockquote> [G]am­ing is a mat­ter that falls with­in the “dou­ble as­pect” doc­trine.  Accordingly, gam­ing can be sub­ject to leg­is­la­tion by both the fed­er­al and provin­cial gov­ern­ments.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><a href="#fn-12" class="undecorated"><span class="sidenote-number" id="fn-source-12"></span></a></span></blockquote><div class="endnotes"><p><h2 hyphens="none">Notes</h2></p><p class="footnote" id="fn-1">1. <a href="#fn-source-1" class="backlink undecorated"> ↑ </a>“Part 2.1 does cross the line be­tween en­vi­ron­men­tal laws of gen­er­al ap­pli­ca­tion and the reg­u­la­tion of fed­er­al un­der­tak­ings.
